    "In 1962 Ayn&#xA0;Rand accepted an invitation to write a weekly column in the\n<cite>Los Angeles Times</cite>, and from events and controversies that have by\nnow faded from the news, she was able to draw timeless lessons. Commenting on\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, she identified the inevitable\nconsequences of President Kennedy&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/appeasement.html\">appeasement</a>&#x2014;at home and abroad. About\nthe Algerian civil war, she observed: &#x201C;A majority without an <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/ideology.html\">ideology</a> is a\nhelpless mob, to be taken over by anyone.&#x201D; And about <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/socialism.html\">socialistic</a> policies\nespoused by <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/liberals.html\">liberals</a> and <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/conservatives.html\">conservatives</a>, she noted that &#x201C;no one&#x2019;s\nwelfare can be achieved by anyone&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/sacrifice.html\">sacrifice</a>.&#x201D;",
    "The 26 columns range widely in topic&#x2014;from a celebration of Victor Hugo&#x2019;s\nnovel <a href=\"https://estore.aynrand.org/p/497/ninety-three-hardcover\"><cite>Ninety-three</cite></a> and Britain&#x2019;s entry into the (European)\nCommon Market to the causes of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/war.html\">war</a> and peace.",
    "Unlike so much &#x201C;journalistic commentary&#x2014;which is stale and irrelevant just\ndays, or hours after it is written&#x2014;virtually nothing of hers becomes\noutdated,&#x201D; explains the editor&#x2019;s introduction. &#x201C;Her perspective is that of a\ngrand historian whose time frame is the centuries and whose function is to\nexplain the world by reference to universal <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/truth.html\">truths</a>.&#x201D;",
