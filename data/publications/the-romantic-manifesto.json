    "<img src=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lib_style/img/rm.jpg\" alt=\"The Romantic Manifest cover\"> In her <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/morality.html\">ethics</a> Ayn&#xA0;Rand extolled\nthe virtue of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/selfishness.html\">selfishness</a>&#x2014;and in her theory of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/art.html\">art</a> she was no less\nradical. Piercing the fog of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/mysticism.html\">mysticism</a> and sentimentality that engulfs art,\nthe essays in <cite>The Romantic Manifesto</cite> explain why, since time\nimmemorial, man has created and consumed works of art.",
    "Ayn&#xA0;Rand argues that <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.html\">objective</a> standards in art are possible because art is\nnot a <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/subjectivism.html\">subjective</a> luxury, but rather a critical need of human life&#x2014;not a\nmaterial need, but a need of man&#x2019;s rational mind, the faculty on which his\nmaterial survival depends.",
    "Ayn&#xA0;Rand explains the indispensable function of art in man&#x2019;s life (ch. 1), the\nobjective source of man&#x2019;s deeply personal, emotional response to art (ch. 2),\nand how an artist&#x2019;s fundamental, often unstated view of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/man.html\">man</a> and of the\nworld shapes his creations (ch. 3).",
    "Turning to her own field of artistic creation, Rand elaborates (ch. 5) on her\ndistinctive theory of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/literature.html\">literature</a> and identifies <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/principles.html\">principles</a> by which to\njudge an artwork objectively. &#x201C;What is <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html\">Romanticism</a>?&#x201D; (ch. 6) sheds new\nlight on the nature and philosophy of the school of literature under which Rand\nclassified her own work. Later essays explain how contemporary art reveals the\ndebased intellectual state of our culture (ch. 7, 8 and 9).",
    "In the final essay Rand articulates the goal of her own fiction writing as &#x201C;the\nprojection of an ideal man, as an end in itself&#x201D;&#x2014;and explains that she\noriginated her philosophy as a means to this end.",
