    "<img src=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lib_style/img/theaynrandletter.jpg\" alt=\"The Ayn&#xA0;Rand Letter cover\"> Through the 1960s and early &#x2019;70s, Ayn\nRand edited and published a series of periodicals. The last of these was a\nbiweekly newsletter called <cite>The Ayn&#xA0;Rand Letter</cite>, which was\npublished from October 1971 to February 1976. This 400-page volume reproduces\nthe entire contents of each issue.",
    "While the articles in <cite>The Ayn&#xA0;Rand Letter</cite> address a broad range of\ntopics&#x2014;from the Vietnam war to the TV show <cite>Perry Mason</cite> to the\nmetaphysical lessons of chess&#x2014;they are united by a common theme: that\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/philosophy.html\">philosophy</a> is not an ivory-towered diversion divorced from practical\nconcerns, but is an indispensable guide to understanding the real world and\nacting successfully in it. In her article &#x201C;Philosophy: Who Needs\nIt&#x201D;&#x2014;originally delivered as a lecture to the 1974 graduating class at West\nPoint&#x2014;Rand&#x2019;s answer to the question implied by the title is: everyone.",
    "Many of the articles that Rand wrote for the <cite>Letter</cite> were collected\nin the books <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/philosophy-who-needs-it.html\"><cite>Philosophy: Who Needs It</cite></a>, which was published\nafter her death in 1982, and <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/the-voice-of-reason.html\"><cite>The Voice of Reason</cite></a>, published\nin 1990. In addition to the essay &#x201C;Philosophy: Who Needs It,&#x201D; these include\n&#x201C;<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/metaphysical_vs_man-made.html\">The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made</a>,&#x201D; an analysis&#x2014;drawing on Rand&#x2019;s\nview of the basic nature of reality&#x2014;of what is and what is not open to change,\nand &#x201C;The Lessons of Vietnam,&#x201D; in which Rand identifies in fundamental\nphilosophic terms the causes of America&#x2019;s failure in the Vietnam war.",
    "But while many of the articles in the <cite>Letter</cite> are reprinted in\nthese books, many are not, and like all of Rand&#x2019;s essays, they offer the\nintriguing perspective of a world-historical philosopher commenting on the\nmajor issues of her day. In &#x201C;The Principals and the Principles&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Energy\nCrisis,&#x201D; for example, Rand identifies the essential similarity between the\nWatergate scandal and the 1970s energy crisis: both illustrate in different\nways the corruption inherent in, and the destruction wreaked by, a mixed\neconomy. In &#x201C;Ideas v. Goods&#x201D; and &#x201C;Ideas v. Men,&#x201D; she condemns the intellectual\nbankruptcy of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/conservatives.html\">conservatives</a>, as revealed by a conservative economist&#x2019;s\nattack on freedom of the press. And in &#x201C;The Shanghai Gesture,&#x201D; Rand explains\nwhy President Nixon&#x2019;s historic visit to China&#x2014;which is widely regarded today\nas a triumph of Nixon&#x2019;s presidency&#x2014;was, in fact, a total failure of moral\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/principles.html\">principle</a>.",
