    "<img src=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lib_style/img/fountainhead_current_cover.jpg\" alt=\"The Fountainhead Novel cover\"> <cite>The Fountainhead</cite> (1943)\nintroduced the world to architect Howard Roark, an intransigent individualist.\nA man whose arrogant pride in his work is fully earned, Roark is an innovator\nwho battles against a tradition-worshipping society&#x2014;refusing to compromise his\nstandards in work and life.  Expelled from a prestigious architectural school,\nrefused work, reduced to laboring in a granite quarry, Roark is never stopped.\nHe has to withstand not merely professional rejection, but also the enmity of\nEllsworth Toohey, beloved humanitarian and leading architectural critic; of\nGail Wynand, powerful publisher; and of Dominique Francon, the beautiful\ncolumnist who loves him fervently yet is bent on destroying his career.",
    "With <cite>The Fountainhead</cite>, Ayn&#xA0;Rand achieved enduring commercial,\nartistic, and intellectual success.  Initially rejected by a dozen publishers,\n<cite>The Fountainhead</cite> became a bestseller within two years purely\nthrough word of mouth; today, there are over six million copies in print.  The\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/novel.html\">novel</a> was also an artistic landmark for Rand; in the character of Howard\nRoark, she presented for the first time the uniquely Ayn&#xA0;Rand hero, whose\ndepiction was the chief goal of her writing: the ideal man, <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/man.html\">man</a> as &#x201C;he\ncould be and ought to be.&#x201D; The novel&#x2019;s dramatization of its original\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/theme_(literary).html\">theme</a>&#x2014;in Rand&#x2019;s words &#x201C;<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualism.html\">individualism</a> versus <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/collectivism.html\">collectivism</a>, not in\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/politics.html\">politics</a>, but in man&#x2019;s soul&#x201D;&#x2014;earned Rand a lasting reputation as one of\nhistory&#x2019;s greatest champions of individualism."
