    "Set in post-revolutionary Russia, <cite>We The Living</cite> tells the moving\nstory of three people struggling against Soviet oppression: the novel&#x2019;s\nheroine Kira Argounova, a young woman whose fiercely <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/independence.html\">independent</a> spirit\nrebels against communism; Leo Kovalenksy, the man she loves, whose bourgeois\norigins mark him as an enemy of the state; and Andrei Taganov, an officer of\nthe Soviet Secret police who is forced to confront the clash between his ideals\nand the reality of communist life.",
    "The novel&#x2019;s portrayal of the destructive effects of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/collectivism.html\">collectivism</a> reflects\nAyn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s focus in her early <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/philosophy.html\">philosophic</a> thinking on <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/morality.html\">moral</a> and\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/politics.html\">political</a> issues; its <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/theme_(literary).html\">theme</a>, she said, is &#x201C;the <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualism.html\">individual</a>\nagainst the state.&#x201D; Published (with considerable difficulty) at the height of\nthe Red Decade, American intellectuals&#x2019; infatuation with Soviet Russia,\n<cite>We The Living</cite> is an indictment not merely of Soviet-style\nCommunism, but of any and every totalitarian state that claims the right to\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/sacrifice.html\">sacrifice</a> the supreme <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/values.html\">value</a> of an individual human life.",
    "Explaining the autobiographical nature of <cite>We The Living</cite>, Ayn&#xA0;Rand\nwrote that &#x201C;it is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the\nintellectual, sense. The plot is invented; the background is not.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. I was\nborn in Russia, I was educated under the Soviets, I have seen the conditions of\nexistence that I describe.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The specific events of Kira&#x2019;s life were not\nmine; her ideas, her convictions, her values were and are.&#x201D;",
