    "<img src=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lib_style/img/capitalismtheunknownideal.jpg\" alt=\"Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal\">Readers of <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>\nare struck by the moral fire of Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s defense of business and\ncapitalism. She does not regard <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html\">capitalism</a> as an <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/amoralism.html\">amoral</a> or\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/evil.html\">immoral</a> means to some &#x201C;<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/common_good.html\">common good</a>&#x201C;&#x2014;as do most of its\ndefenders&#x2014;but as a profoundly <em><a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/morality.html\">moral</a></em> <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/social_system.html\">social system</a>. It is, she\nwrote, &#x201C;the only system geared to the life of a rational being.&#x201D;",
    "In <cite>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</cite>, which Ayn&#xA0;Rand called &#x201C;a\nnonfiction footnote to <cite><a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/atlas-shrugged.html\">Atlas Shrugged</a></cite>,&#x201D; she and others\nexplain the social system that she held has &#x201C;never been properly\nunderstood and defended&#x2014;and whose very existence has been denied.&#x201D; That\nsystem is <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism: a social system in which the\ngovernment is exclusively devoted to the protection of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html\">individual\nrights</a>, including <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/property_rights.html\">property rights</a>, and therefore in which there\nexists absolutely no government intervention in the economy.",
    "<cite>Capitalism</cite> is not a treatise on the economics of\ncapitalism, but a collection of essays on the <em>philosophy</em> of\ncapitalism: the basic truths and principles that make capitalism the\nonly moral and practical social system&#x2014;the only system consistent with\nman&#x2019;s nature and the requirements of his <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/life.html\">life</a>&#x2014;the only one that\nenables each individual to reach his full, glorious potential.",
    "<cite>Capitalism</cite> features Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s landmark essay &#x201C;What is\nCapitalism?&#x201D; in which she explains the view of ethics, epistemology,\nmetaphysics, and human nature that is necessary for a proper\nunderstanding and defense of capitalism.",
    "In other essays, Rand explains how the principles of individual rights\nand <em>laissez-faire</em> can resolve such issues as the nature of patents and\ncopyrights and the property status of airwaves.",
    "Still other essays by her and colleagues address the true history and\nfunctioning of capitalism, demolishing many widespread myths about it.\nAmong the issues covered are explanation of why capitalism is the key to\npeace and <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/statism.html\">statism</a>, the cause of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/war.html\">war</a>&#x2014;how depressions are caused\nby government intervention&#x2014;how capitalism put an end to child labor&#x2014;and\nwhy capitalism doesn&#x2019;t lead to <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/monopoly.html\">monopolies</a>.",
    "Finally, <cite>Capitalism</cite> features several essays by Rand\nanalyzing the conflict between capitalism and statism in the political\ndevelopments of the 20th century. While many of the news events she\nanalyzes (such as the 1964 Republican convention) are mostly forgotten,\nher penetrating analysis gives insights and teaches lessons about\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/conservatives_vs_liberals.html\">conservatives and liberals</a>, domestic and <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/foreign_policy.html\">foreign policy</a> that\nremain relevant to this day. Just a few of her insights are: how\nAmerica&#x2019;s moral appeasement of the <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/united_nations.html\">United Nations</a> diminishes our\nreputation and undermines our interests&#x2014;how liberals succeed at smearing\ncapitalism as &#x201C;extremist&#x201D;&#x2014;why conservatives fail to defend\ncapitalism&#x2014;why <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/antitrust_laws.html\">antitrust laws</a> are profoundly unjust&#x2014;why a political\nideology is necessary and why its opposite, the seeking of political\n&#x201C;consensus,&#x201D; is destructive.",
    "<cite>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</cite> is must-reading for anyone\nwho wants to understand capitalism and discover Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s\nground-breaking political philosophy and moral defense of\n<em>laissez-faire</em>.",
