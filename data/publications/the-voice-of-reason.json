    "<img src=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lib_style/img/thevoiceofreason.gif\" alt=\"The Voice of Reason cover\"> As you will learn from this collection\nof essays, most written by Ayn&#xA0;Rand, her philosophy of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-ideas/introducing-objectivism.html\">Objectivism</a> entailed\nthat she was neither a <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/liberals.html\">&#x201C;liberal&#x201D;</a> (see chs. 10 and 13) nor a\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/conservatives.html\">&#x201C;conservative&#x201D;</a> (chs. 8 and 14) nor a <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/libertarians.html\">&#x201C;Libertarian&#x201D;</a> (ch.  31)&#x2014;but\ninstead, an uncompromising advocate for <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html\">reason</a> and <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html\">self-interest</a>. That\ncommitment to <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/rationality.html\">rationality</a> informs Rand&#x2019;s distinctive intellectual\napproach, manifest in the essays in this book: she penetrates to the timeless,\nfundamental ideas underlying a given event, movement, or issue.",
    "In &#x201C;The Lessons of Vietnam,&#x201D; for example, Rand argues (ch. 14) that the\nfundamental failure of that war lay not with America&#x2019;s military, but with its\nmorally bankrupt intellectual and political leaders. Discussing the persistence\nof world hunger (ch. 28), she notes that its cause is not a shortage of Western\nfinancial support, but a shortage in the Third World of Western ideas.\nCulpability for the death of Marilyn Monroe (ch. 16), Rand argues, rests with\nanyone who has ever felt and given voice to a resentment against human\nachievement. The enduring tragedy of American businessmen, she explains (ch.\n15), is that they lend <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/morality.html\">moral</a> (and financial) support to their own\ndestroyers.",
    "<cite>The Voice of Reason</cite> also features a number of landmark essays on\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/philosophy.html\">philosophy</a> and its relation to human life. Rand discusses <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/religion.html\">religion</a>&#x2019;s\nwar on human life (ch. 8); considers the progressive <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/psychology.html\">psychological</a> damage\nincurred by men who embrace the ethics of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/altruism.html\">altruism</a> (ch. 6), and responds to\nthe popular question &#x201C;Who decides what is right or wrong?&#x201D; by explaining the\nprofound error contained in this question (ch. 4).",
