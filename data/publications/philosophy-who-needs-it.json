    "<img src=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lib_style/img/pwni.jpg\" alt=\"Philosophy: Who Needs It cover\"> Most people dismiss\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/philosophy.html\">philosophy</a> as irrelevant to life, but as Ayn&#xA0;Rand shows in novels like\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/the-fountainhead.html\"><cite>The Fountainhead</cite></a> and <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/atlas-shrugged.html\"><cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite></a>,\nliving by the correct fundamental ideas is as crucial to human existence as\nfood and water. The articles in this collection explain and develop Rand&#x2019;s\nunique view on the role of philosophy in man&#x2019;s life.",
    "In the titular essay, &#x201C;Philosophy: Who Needs It,&#x201D; Rand shows why, in order to\ndeal with concrete, real-life problems, an individual needs some implicit or\nexplicit view of the world, of man&#x2019;s place in it, and of what goals and values\nhe ought to pursue. The abstract premises an individual holds may be true and\nconsistent, reached by conscientious thought&#x2014;and the purpose of the science of\nphilosophy is to teach one how to achieve this&#x2014;or his premises may be a heap\nof clashing ideas unwittingly absorbed from the culture around him. But either\nway, she argues, the power of philosophy is inescapable. It is something\neveryone should be concerned with. How to properly approach and study\nphilosophy is then discussed in &#x201C;Philosophic Detection&#x201D; (ch. 2).",
    "Subsequent essays reveal the true power of philosophy, for good or ill, in\nhuman affairs. In &#x201C;Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World&#x201D; (ch.\n7), for instance, Ayn&#xA0;Rand discusses how a culture&#x2019;s political system is the\nproduct of its philosophic ideas. She explains why rational ideas lead to\nfreedom&#x2014;and why periods dominated by religion and other irrational doctrines\nare periods of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/statism.html\">statism</a>, of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/dictatorship.html\">dictatorship</a>, of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/tyranny.html\">tyranny</a>.",
    "Her seminal essay &#x201C;Causality vs. Duty&#x201D; (ch. 10) explains what mankind&#x2019;s\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/morality.html\">moral</a> teachings actually do to an individual life by contrasting a person\nwho obeys the <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/duty.html\">&#x201C;duty&#x201D;</a> to be <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/selflessness.html\">selfless</a> with a person who accepts her\nalternative of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/selfishness.html\">rational egoism</a>. For the former, morality is a debilitating\nimpediment to achieving his values; for the latter, morality is a necessary\nmeans to attaining his own happiness.",
    "Other essays underscore the power of philosophy by highlighting its influence\nin such unexpected areas as the mentality and government policies driving U.S.\nmonetary <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/inflation.html\">inflation</a> (ch. 12), the appeal of chess in Soviet Russia (ch. 6),\nand the unnamed premises shaping the Supreme Court&#x2019;s ominous rulings on\nobscenity (ch. 15).",
    "If you wonder why Ayn&#xA0;Rand was so passionate about philosophy, this book will help you to understand.",
