    "<img src=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lib_style/img/theominousparallels.jpg\" alt=\"Ominous Parallels cover\">Almost everyone acknowledges that\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/fascism-nazism.html\">Nazism</a> was one of the greatest horrors of the 20th century, yet few\nunderstand its deepest cause. How did a supposedly <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/civilization.html\">civilized</a>\ncountry&#x2014; the &#x201C;land of poets and philosophers&#x201D;&#x2014;degenerate into a\nmurderous, totalitarian <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/dictatorship.html\">dictatorship</a>? What made the Nazi campaign of\nmurder possible? Can we be sure it won&#x2019;t happen here in <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/america.html\">America</a>?",
    "Leonard Peikoff answers these questions in <cite>The Ominous\nParallels</cite>, a study of the alarming similarities between America\ntoday and Germany just prior to and during the Nazi era. In essence, Dr.\nPeikoff&#x2019;s answer is that the ultimate cause of Nazism was\n<em><a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/philosophy.html\">philosophy</a></em>. Nazism, he argues, was made possible by a long line of\nGerman philosophers who advocated <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/irrationalism.html\">unreason</a> and <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/sacrifice.html\">self-sacrifice</a>.",
    "In her introduction, Ayn&#xA0;Rand praises the book as offering &#x201C;a truly\nrevolutionary idea in the field of the philosophy of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/history.html\">history</a>.&#x201D; What\nis that idea? It is the idea that philosophy is the motor of history&#x2014;the\nfundamental cause of history&#x2019;s major trends and the power that\n&#x201C;determines the destiny of nations.&#x201D; Because it addresses the most\nfundamental questions of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/man.html\">man&#x2019;s</a> <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/existence.html\">existence</a>, philosophy sets the\nterms for all other fields of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/knowledge.html\">knowledge</a> and for all human action.\n<cite>The Ominous Parallels</cite> shows in detail the role that the\nfalse ideas of Germany&#x2019;s most respected philosophers played in shaping\nevery element of pre-Nazi <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/culture.html\">culture</a> and in preparing that culture to\nembrace Nazism&#x2019;s murderous <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/ideology.html\">ideology</a>. In doing so, Peikoff shows the\nconnection between seemingly dry, abstract philosophical theory and the\nblood-soaked practice of the Holocaust.",
    "Disturbingly, Dr. Peikoff finds that the same fundamental ideas that\ndrove Germany to Hitler are dominant in American universities today. The\nbook&#x2019;s thesis is that all the philosophic <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/principles.html\">principles</a> that led to the\nrise of Nazism in Germany have their parallels in contemporary America.\nAs a result, the nation is moving towards the establishment of a\nNazi-style dictatorship. As Dr. Peikoff writes near the end of the book:",
    "Dr. Peikoff concludes the book with a brief and inspiring discussion of\nthe positive ideas needed to change America&#x2019;s direction.",
