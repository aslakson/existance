    "<img src=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lib_style/img/thevirture.jpg\" alt=\"The Virtue of Selfishness cover\"> Throughout history, man has been\noffered the following alternative: be &#x201C;moral&#x201D; through a life of sacrifice to\nothers&#x2014;or be &#x201C;selfish&#x201D; through a life of sacrificing others to oneself. In\n<cite>The Virtue of Selfishness</cite>, Ayn&#xA0;Rand blasts this as a false\nalternative, holding that a selfish, non-sacrificial way of life is both\npossible and necessary for man.",
    "<cite>The Virtue of Selfishness</cite> is a collection of essays presenting Ayn\nRand&#x2019;s radical moral code of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/selfishness.html\">rational selfishness</a> and its opposition to\nthe prevailing morality of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/altruism.html\">altruism</a>&#x2014;i.e., to the <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/duty.html\">duty</a> to sacrifice for\nthe sake of others.",
    "In &#x201C;The Objectivist Ethics,&#x201D; Rand gives an outline of her code of rational\nselfishness, and of her argument establishing it as the only objective,\nfact-based <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/morality.html\">moral code</a> in human history. In the course of the essay, she\nraises and answers a fundamental and fascinating question: Why does one even\nneed a morality?",
    "In essays including &#x201C;The Ethics of Emergencies,&#x201D; &#x201C;The &#x2018;Conflicts&#x2019; of Men&#x2019;s\nInterests,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t Life Require Compromise?&#x201D; she raises common ethical\nquestions, shows how altruism has crippled people&#x2019;s ability to approach them\nrationally, and explains how her moral code provides a solution to them. In\n&#x201C;<a href=\"http://ari.aynrand.org/issues/government-and-business/individual-rights/Mans-Rights\">Man&#x2019;s Rights</a>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<a href=\"http://ari.aynrand.org/issues/government-and-business/individual-rights/Mans-Rights\">The Nature of Government</a>&#x201D; she applies her ethics\nto formulate the basic principles of her political philosophy, while rejecting\nthe altruistic doctrines of &#x201C;rights&#x201D; to health care, employment, etc.",
    "<cite>The Virtue of Selfishness</cite> is indispensable reading for anyone who\nwants to understand the crucial ethical issues at the root at so many of our\ncultural debates today&#x2014;who wants to understand the revolutionary ideas that\nguide the lives of Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s fictional heroes&#x2014;who wants to lead an existence\nthat is both moral and practical&#x2014;who wants to discover why, in the words of\none of the heroes of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/atlas-shrugged.html\"><cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite></a>, &#x201C;the purpose of morality\nis to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.&#x201D;",
