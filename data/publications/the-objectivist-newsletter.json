    "<img src=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lib_style/img/theobjectivistnewsletter.jpg\" alt=\"The Objectivist Newsletter cover\"> Through the 1960s and early\n&#x2019;70s, Ayn&#xA0;Rand edited and published a series of monthly periodicals. <cite>The\nObjectivist Newsletter</cite> was produced from January 1962 to December 1965\n(when it converted to magazine format under the title <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/the-objectivist.html\"><cite>The\nObjectivist</cite></a>). This 224-page volume reproduces the entire contents\nof each issue.",
    "The focus of the <cite>Newsletter</cite> was the application of Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s\nphilosophy, <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-ideas/introducing-objectivism.html\">Objectivism</a>, to contemporary cultural issues and concerns. Its\npurpose was, in Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s words, &#x201C;to provide its readers with a consistent\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/philosophy.html\">philosophical</a> frame of reference.&#x201D;",
    "Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s broad, philosophical perspective on the issues she discussed gives\nthe articles in <cite>The Objectivist Newsletter</cite>&#x2014;though written over 40\nyears ago&#x2014;a timelessness and relevance transcending the journalistic details\nof their day. For example, in her article &#x201C;&#x2018;Extremism&#x2019;: or The Art of\nSmearing,&#x201D; she extracts a profound <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/epistemology.html\">epistemological</a> lesson concerning an\ninsidious and widespread misuse of man&#x2019;s mind and <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/concepts.html\">concepts</a> .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. from\ncomments made by the candidates at the 1964 Republican National Convention.",
    "Moreover, many of the journalistic issues discussed in the\n<cite>Newsletter</cite> are ones that, unfortunately, still appear all-too\nfrequently in today&#x2019;s newspaper headlines. The very first article of the very\nfirst issue, for example, discusses two political issues with which, in Ayn\nRand&#x2019;s view, the practical fight for <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/freedom.html\">freedom</a> should begin: the growing\ndestructiveness of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/antitrust.html\">antitrust law</a> and the growing power of the government to\ncensor <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/free_speech.html\">speech</a>.",
    "To get an idea of the caliber of the articles, note that the material for Ayn\nRand&#x2019;s essay collections, such as <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/capitalism-the-unknown-ideal.html\"><cite>Capitalism: the Unknown\nIdeal</cite></a>, was drawn primarily from the pages of her periodicals. For\ninstance, her articles <a href=\"http://ari.aynrand.org/issues/government-and-business/individual-rights/Mans-Rights#filter-bar\">&#x201C;Man&#x2019;s Rights&#x201D;</a>) and <a href=\"http://ari.aynrand.org/issues/government-and-business/individual-rights/Mans-Rights#filter-bar\">&#x201C;The Nature of Government,&#x201D;</a>\nwhich were included in the book <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/the-virtue-of-selfishness.html\"><cite>The Virtue of Selfishness</cite></a>,\nwere originally published in <cite>The Objectivist Newsletter</cite> (in the\nApril and December 1963 issues, respectively.)",
    "But while many of the <cite>Newsletter</cite> articles were later anthologized,\nmany were not and are unavailable in any other format. For instance, in &#x201C;Who\nWill Protect Us from Our Protectors?&#x201D; (May 1962), Ayn&#xA0;Rand demolishes the\nnotion of &#x201C;consumer&#x2019;s rights,&#x201D; and in &#x201C;How to Judge a Political Candidate&#x201D;\n(March 1964) and &#x201C;It&#x2019;s Earlier Than You Think&#x201D; (December 1964)&#x2014;which discuss\nBarry Goldwater&#x2019;s run for the presidency in 1964&#x2014;she draws timeless lessons\nconcerning the futility of pro-capitalist political efforts without a <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/morality.html\">moral</a>\nand intellectual defense of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html\">capitalism</a>.",
    "A unique regular feature of <cite>The Objectivist Newsletter</cite> was its\n&#x201C;Intellectual Ammunition Department,&#x201D; which replied to questions on philosophy\nand Objectivism from readers. Ayn&#xA0;Rand and her colleagues offered detailed\nanswers to questions on such wide-ranging topics as: the evil of\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/agnosticism.html\">agnosticism</a>, the nature of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/freewill.html\">free will</a>, the status of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/patents_and_copyrights.html\">patents and\ncopyrights</a>, why capitalism is incompatible with <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/religion.html\">religion</a>, and how the\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/government.html\">government</a> of a free society would be financed.",
    "<cite>The Objectivist Newsletter</cite> also featured regular book reviews\nwritten from an Objectivist perspective&#x2014;reviews of works by fiction writers as\ndiverse as Victor Hugo and Mickey Spillane and of nonfiction works by authors\nsuch as Ludwig von Mises and Henry Hazlitt.",
    "All these essays are indispensible reading for fans of Ayn&#xA0;Rand.",
