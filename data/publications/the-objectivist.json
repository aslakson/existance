    "<img src=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lib_style/img/theobjectivist.jpg\" alt=\"The Objectivist cover\"> Through the 1960s and early &#x2019;70s, Ayn&#xA0;Rand edited\nand published a series of monthly periodicals. The first of these was\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/the-objectivist-newsletter.html\"><cite>The Objectivist Newsletter</cite></a>, which ran from January 1962 to\nDecember 1965. The growth and success of the newsletter over its four-year run\njustified expanding it to a magazine format under the title <cite>The\nObjectivist</cite>.",
    "<cite>The Objectivist</cite> magazine was published from January 1966 to\nSeptember 1971 (when it was replaced by a biweekly newsletter called\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/the-ayn-rand-letter.html\"><cite>The Ayn&#xA0;Rand Letter</cite></a>.)\nThis 1120-page volume reproduces the entire contents of each issue.",
    "Like the <cite>Newsletter</cite>, the focus of<cite>The Objectivist</cite> was\nthe application of Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s philosophy, <em><a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-ideas/introducing-objectivism.html\">Objectivism</a></em>, to contemporary\ncultural issues and concerns. Its purpose was, in Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s words, &#x201C;to\nprovide its readers with a consistent philosophical frame of reference.&#x201D;",
    "Some of Rand&#x2019;s most important pieces of nonfiction writing first appeared in\nher magazine. For example, her monograph <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/introduction-to-objectivist-epistemology.html\"><cite>Introduction to Objectivist\nEpistemology</cite></a>, which presents her revolutionary theory of\nconcepts, was first published in installments in the July 1966 through February\n1967 issues.",
    "What is striking about the articles in <cite>The Objectivist</cite> is the\nrange of topics addressed by Rand and the contributing writers under her\neditorial supervision: from theoretical essays on metaphysics and\nepistemology&#x2014;to articles applying Objectivism to fields as diverse as\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/psychology.html\">psychology</a>, <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/history.html\">history</a>, <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/education.html\">education</a>, <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/science.html\">science</a>, <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/politics.html\">politics</a> and\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/book/conceptual.html#economics\">economics</a>&#x2014;to articles commenting on concrete news events such as the 1969\nmoon landing. Numerous articles present Rand&#x2019;s distinctive philosophy of\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/art.html\">art</a>, and apply it by analyzing cultural trends in theater, <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/motion_pictures.html\">film</a> and\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/literature.html\">literature</a>.",
    "While most of Rand&#x2019;s articles have been reprinted elsewhere, many of those\nfrom contributing writers have not. (The most substantial of her cultural\ncommentaries not available anywhere else is her analysis of the 1968\npresidential race that brought Richard Nixon to the White House.)",
    "In addition, aficionados of Rand&#x2019;s philosophy will find it fascinating to\nperuse certain regular features of <cite>The Objectivist</cite>. There are\noccasional editorial reports on the spread of Objectivism in the culture and on\ncollege campuses. And the &#x201C;Objectivist Calendar&#x201D; listed upcoming events such as\nlectures and TV and radio appearances by Rand and her associates. While such\nitems are undoubtedly dated, they nevertheless offer a glimpse into the history\nof Objectivism as an intellectual movement.",
    "One unique regular feature in <cite>The Objectivist</cite> was a series of\nexcerpts &#x201C;From the &#x2018;Horror File,&#x2019;&#x201D;&#x2014;a collection of quotations sent in by\nreaders illustrating the horrific state of contemporary ideas and culture. Its\npurpose was &#x201C;to illustrate the tie, ignored by too many people, between the\npresent state of the culture and its philosophical roots&#x2014;to demonstrate that\ntoday&#x2019;s intellectual trends are as bad as we charge (or worse)&#x2014;to indicate\nthe kind of ideas that have to be fought and to remind you that the battle lies\nin the field of ideas.&#x201D; Examples of items from the &#x201C;Horror File&#x201D; include the\nfollowing:",
