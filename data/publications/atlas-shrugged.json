    "<cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> (1957)&#x2014;her masterwork and last <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/novel.html\">novel</a>&#x2014;is the\nbrilliant dramatization of her unique vision of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/existence.html\">existence</a> and of <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/man.html\">man</a>&#x2019;s\nhighest <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/purpose.html\">purpose</a> and potential in <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/life.html\">life</a>. If you want to read just one\nbook to understand Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s worldview, this is the book.",
    "Ayn&#xA0;Rand loved to read&#x2014;and so wanted to write&#x2014;fiction for the sake of the\nstory. She would ask herself: &#x201C;Is this story an experience worth living through\nfor its own sake? Is the pleasure of contemplating these <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/characterization.html\">characters</a> an end\nin itself?&#x201D;",
    "As millions of readers have discovered, <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> is\nprecisely the kind of novel you cannot put down.",
    "<cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> sweeps the reader into its own world of\nlarger-than-life characters&#x2014;including the <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/productiveness.html\">productive</a> genius who becomes a\nworthless playboy and the great industrialist who doesn&#x2019;t know that he is\nworking for his own destruction. The story is a mystery about a man who said\nthat he would stop the motor of the world&#x2014;and did.  <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/society.html\">Society</a> disintegrates, food\nshortages spark riots, factories shutdown by the hundreds. Is this man a\nvicious destroyer&#x2014;or the greatest of liberators? What is the motor of the\nworld? What is required to restart it?",
    "The answers emerge in the novel&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/logic.html\">logical</a> yet astounding climax.  The\nanswers are of profound significance not merely for the resolution of the\nstory&#x2019;s central conflict&#x2014; but also for man&#x2019;s life in <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/existence.html\">reality</a>, today.",
    "<cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> presents the consummate Ayn&#xA0;Rand hero&#x2014;and the\nradically new <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/morality.html\">moral</a> and <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/philosophy.html\">philosophic</a> <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/principles.html\">principles</a> by which he lives.\nThis philosophic underpinning is the system of ideas Ayn&#xA0;Rand called\n<em><a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-ideas/introducing-objectivism.html\">Objectivism</a></em>.",
    "With the publication of <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>, Ayn&#xA0;Rand&#x2019;s\ncareer as a fiction writer came to an end. In subsequent years, she devoted her\ntime to lecturing and writing extensively on the nature and applications of\n<em>her new philosophy</em>.",
