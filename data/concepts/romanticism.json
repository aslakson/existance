It deals, not with the random\ntrivia of the day, but with the timeless, fundamental, universal problems and\n<em>values</em> of human existence. It does not record or photograph; it creates and\nprojects. It is concerned&#x2014;in the words of Aristotle&#x2014;not with things as they\nare, but with things as they might be and ought to be.",

Values (and value-judgments)\nare the source of emotions; a great deal of emotional intensity was projected\nin the work of the Romanticists and in the reactions of their audiences, as\nwell as a great deal of color, imagination, originality, excitement and all the\nother consequences of a value-oriented view of life. This emotional element was\nthe most easily perceivable characteristic of the new movement and it was taken\nas its defining characteristic, without deeper inquiry.",
