The nature of an action is caused and determined by the\nnature of the entities that act; a thing cannot act in contradiction to its\nnature .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eat\nit, too.  The law of causality does not permit you to eat your cake <em>before</em>\nyou have it.",

Whether its basic constituent elements are\natoms, or subatomic particles, or some yet undiscovered forms of energy, it is\nnot ruled by a consciousness or by will or by chance, but by the law of\nidentity.  All the countless forms, motions, combinations and dissolutions of\nelements within the universe&#x2014;from a floating speck of dust to the formation of\na galaxy to the emergence of life&#x2014;are caused and determined by the identities\nof the elements involved.",
