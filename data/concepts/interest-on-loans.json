The payment is for the risk\nhe is taking: nature does not guarantee man&#x2019;s success, neither on a farm nor in\na factory. If the venture fails, it means that the goods have been consumed\nwithout a productive return, so the investor loses his money; if the venture\nsucceeds, the producer pays the interest out of the new goods, the <em>profits</em>,\nwhich the investment enabled him to make.",
