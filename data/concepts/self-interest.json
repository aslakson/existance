This is why the Objectivist\nethics is a morality of <em>rational</em> self-interest&#x2014;or of <em>rational selfishness</em>.",

      "content": "When one speaks of man&#x2019;s right to exist for his own sake, for his own rational\nself-interest, most people assume automatically that this means his right to\nsacrifice others. Such an assumption is a confession of their own belief that\nto injure, enslave, rob or murder others is in man&#x2019;s self-interest&#x2014;which he\nmust selflessly renounce. The idea that man&#x2019;s self-interest can be served only\nby a non-sacrificial relationship with others has never occurred to those\nhumanitarian apostles of unselfishness, who proclaim their desire to achieve\nthe brotherhood of men. And it will not occur to them, or to anyone, so long as\nthe concept &#x201C;rational&#x201D; is omitted from the context of &#x201C;values,&#x201D; &#x201C;desires,&#x201D;\n&#x201C;self-interest&#x201D; and <em>ethics</em>.",

A man&#x2019;s &#x201C;interests&#x201D; depend on the kind of\ngoals he chooses to pursue, his choice of goals depends on his desires, his\ndesires depend on his values&#x2014;and, for a rational man, his values depend on the\njudgment of his mind.",
