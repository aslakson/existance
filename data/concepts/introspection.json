A concept pertaining to consciousness is a\nmental integration of two or more instances of a psychological process\npossessing the same distinguishing characteristics, with the particular\ncontents and the measurements of the action&#x2019;s intensity omitted&#x2014;on the\nprinciple that these omitted measurements must exist in <em>some</em> quantity, but\nmay exist in <em>any</em> quantity (i.e., a given psychological process must possess\n<em>some</em> content and <em>some</em> degree of intensity, but may possess <em>any</em> content or\ndegree of the appropriate category).",
