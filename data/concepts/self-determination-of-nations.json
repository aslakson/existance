Just as an individual&#x2019;s right of free action does not include\nthe &#x201C;right&#x201D; to commit crimes (that is, to violate the rights of others), so the\nright of a nation to determine its own form of government does not include the\nright to establish a slave society (that is, to legalize the enslavement of\nsome men by others). <em>There is no such thing as &#x201C;the right to enslave</em>.&#x201D; A\nnation can do it, just as a man can become a criminal&#x2014;but neither can do it by\nright.",
