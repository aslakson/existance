      "content": "The higher organisms possess a much more potent form of consciousness: they\npossess the faculty of <em>retaining</em> sensations, which is the faculty of\n<em>perception</em>. A &#x201C;perception&#x201D; is a group of sensations automatically\nretained and integrated by the brain of a living organism, which gives it the\nability to be aware, not of single stimuli, but of <em>entities</em>, of\nthings. An animal is guided, not merely by immediate sensations, but by\n<em>percepts</em>. Its actions are not single, discrete responses to single,\nseparate stimuli, but are directed by an integrated awareness of the\n<em>perceptual</em> reality confronting it. It is able to grasp the perceptual\nconcretes immediately present and it is able to form automatic perceptual\nassociations, but it can go no further.",
