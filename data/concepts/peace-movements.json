Professing love and\nconcern for the survival of mankind, they keep screaming that the\nnuclear-weapons race should be stopped, that armed force should be abolished as\na means of settling disputes among nations, and that war should be outlawed in\nthe name of humanity. Yet these same peace movements do not oppose\ndictatorships; the political views of their members range through all shades of\nthe statist spectrum, from welfare statism to socialism to fascism to\ncommunism. This means that they are opposed to the use of coercion by one\nnation against another, but not by the government of a nation against its own\ncitizens; it means that they are opposed to the use of force against <em>armed</em>\nadversaries, but not against the <em>disarmed</em>.",

But\nit makes no difference to a man whether he is killed by a nuclear bomb or a\ndynamite bomb or an old-fashioned club. Nor does the number of other victims or\nthe scale of the destruction make any difference to him. And there is something\nobscene in the attitude of those who regard horror as a matter of numbers, who\nare willing to send a small group of youths to die for the tribe, but scream\nagainst the danger to the tribe itself&#x2014;and more: who are willing to condone\nthe slaughter of defenseless victims, but march in protest against wars between\nthe well-armed .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",
