      "content": "Then I saw what was wrong with the world, I saw what destroyed men and nations,\nand where the battle for life had to be fought. I saw that the enemy was an\ninverted morality&#x2014;and that my sanction was its only power. I saw that evil was\nimpotent&#x2014;that evil was the irrational, the blind, the anti-real&#x2014;and that the\nonly weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it. Just as\nthe parasites around me were proclaiming their helpless dependence on my mind\nand were expecting me voluntarily to accept a slavery they had no power to\nenforce, just as they were counting on my self-immolation to provide them with\nthe means of their plan&#x2014;so throughout the world and throughout men&#x2019;s history,\nin every version and form, from the extortions of loafing relatives to the\natrocities of collectivized countries, it is the good, the able, the men of\nreason, who act as their own destroyers, who transfuse to evil the blood of\ntheir virtue and let evil transmit to them the poison of destruction, thus\ngaining for evil the power of survival, and for their own values&#x2014;the impotence\nof death. I saw that there comes a point, in the defeat of any man of virtue,\nwhen his own consent is needed for evil to win&#x2014;and that no manner of injury\ndone to him by others can succeed if he chooses to withhold his consent. I saw\nthat I could put an end to your outrages by pronouncing a single word in my\nmind. I pronounced it. The word was &#x201C;No.&#x201D;",

      "content": "Every kind of ethnic group is enormously sensitive to any slight. If one made a\nderogatory remark about the Kurds of Iran, dozens of voices would leap to their\ndefense. But no one speaks out for businessmen, when they are attacked and\ninsulted by everyone as a matter of routine. What causes this overwhelming\ninjustice? The businessmen&#x2019;s own policies: their betrayal of their own values,\ntheir appeasement of enemies, their compromises&#x2014;all of which add up to an air\nof moral cowardice. Add to it the fact that businessmen are creating and\nsupporting their own destroyers.",
