I mean this term in a sense which applies to the\nquestion of God, but to many other issues also, such as extra-sensory\nperception or the claim that the stars influence man&#x2019;s destiny.  In regard to\nall such claims, the agnostic is the type who says, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t prove these\nclaims are true, but you can&#x2019;t prove they are false, so the only proper\nconclusion is: I don&#x2019;t know; no one knows; no one can know one way or the\nother.&#x201D;",
