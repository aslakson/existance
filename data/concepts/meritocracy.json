      "content": "&#x201C;Meritocracy&#x201D; is an old anti-concept and one of the most contemptible package\ndeals. By means of nothing more than its last five letters, that word\nobliterates the difference between mind and force: it equates the men of\nability with <em>political</em> rulers, and the power of their creative achievements\nwith <em>political</em> power. There is no difference, the word suggests, between\nfreedom and tyranny: an &#x201C;aristocracy&#x201D; is tyranny by a politically established\nelite, a &#x201C;democracy&#x201D; is tyranny by the majority&#x2014;and when a government protects\nindividual rights, the result is tyranny by talent or &#x201C;merit&#x201D; (and since &#x201C;to\nmerit&#x201D; means &#x201C;to deserve,&#x201D; a free society is ruled by the tyranny of justice).",
