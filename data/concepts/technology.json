As such,\ntechnology is not the first step in the development of a given body of\nknowledge, but the last; it is not the most difficult step, but it is the\nultimate step, the implicit purpose, of man&#x2019;s quest for knowledge.",

In\nthe Middle Ages, their weapon was the fear of God. In the nineteenth century,\nthey still invoked the fear of God&#x2014;for instance, they opposed the use of\nanesthesia on the grounds that it defies God&#x2019;s will, since God intended men to\nsuffer. When this weapon wore out, they invoked the will of the collective, the\ngroup, the tribe. But since this weapon has collapsed in their hands, they are\nnow reduced, like cornered animals, to baring their teeth and their souls, and\nto proclaiming that man has no right to exist&#x2014;by the divine will of inanimate\nmatter.",
