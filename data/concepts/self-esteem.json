As a\nbeing of volitional consciousness, he knows that he must know his own value in\norder to maintain his own life. He knows that he has to be <em>right</em>; to be wrong\nin action means danger to his life; to be wrong in person, to be <em>evil</em>, means\nto be unfit for existence.",

The\ngrim joke is on you: that need of self-esteem, which you&#x2019;re unable to explain\nor to define, belongs to <em>my</em> morality, not yours; it&#x2019;s the objective token of\nmy code, it is my proof within your own soul.",
