Man&#x2019;s\nbasic vice, the source of all his evils, is the act of unfocusing his mind, the\nsuspension of his consciousness, which is not blindness, but the refusal to\nsee, not ignorance, but the refusal to know. Irrationality is the rejection of\nman&#x2019;s means of survival and, therefore, a commitment to a course of blind\ndestruction; that which is anti-mind, is anti-life.",
