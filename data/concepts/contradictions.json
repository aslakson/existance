An atom is itself, and so is the universe;\nneither can contradict its own identity; nor can a part contradict the whole.\nNo concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction\ninto the total sum of his knowledge. To arrive at a contradiction is to confess\nan error in one&#x2019;s thinking; to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate one&#x2019;s\nmind and to evict oneself from the realm of reality.",

And all men use them, because they are\ntrue of being <em>qua</em> being .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. For a principle which everyone must have who\nunderstands anything that is, is not a hypothesis .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Evidently then such a\nprinciple is the most certain of all; which principle this is, let us proceed\nto say. It is, that the same attribute cannot at the same time belong and not\nbelong to the same subject and in the same respect.",

He knows that the contradictory is the\nimpossible, that a contradiction cannot be achieved in reality and that the\nattempt to achieve it can lead only to disaster and destruction. Therefore, he\ndoes not permit himself to hold contradictory values, to pursue contradictory\ngoals, or to imagine that the pursuit of a contradiction can ever be to his\ninterest.",
