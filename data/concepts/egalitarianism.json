If the word\n&#x201C;equality&#x201D; is to be taken in any serious or rational sense, the crusade for\nthis belief is dated by about a century or more: the United States of America\nhas made it an anachronism&#x2014;by establishing a system based on the principle of\nindividual rights. &#x201C;Equality,&#x201D; in a human context, is a political term: it\nmeans equality before the law, the equality of fundamental, inalienable rights\nwhich every man possesses by virtue of his birth as a human being, and which\nmay not be infringed or abrogated by man-made institutions, such as titles of\nnobility or the division of men into castes established by law, with special\nprivileges granted to some and denied to others. The rise of capitalism swept\naway all castes, including the institutions of aristocracy and of slavery or\nserfdom.",

Suppose a doctor is called to help a man with a broken leg\nand, instead of setting it, proceeds to break the legs of ten other men,\nexplaining that this would make the patient feel better; when all these men\nbecome crippled for life, the doctor advocates the passage of a law compelling\neveryone to walk on crutches&#x2014;in order to make the cripples feel better and\nequalize the &#x201C;unfairness&#x201D; of nature.",

      "content": "If there were such a thing as a passion for equality (not equality de jure, but\nde facto), it would be obvious to its exponents that there are only two ways to\nachieve it: either by raising all men to the mountaintop&#x2014;or by razing the\nmountains. The first method is impossible because it is the faculty of volition\nthat determines a man&#x2019;s stature and actions; but the nearest approach to it was\ndemonstrated by the United States and capitalism, which protected the freedom,\nthe rewards and the incentives for every individual&#x2019;s achievement, each to the\nextent of his ability and ambition, thus raising the intellectual, moral and\neconomic state of the whole society. The second method is impossible because,\nif mankind were leveled down to the common denominator of its least competent\nmembers, it would not be able to survive (and its best would not choose to\nsurvive on such terms). Yet it is the second method that the altruist\negalitarians are pursuing. The greater the evidence of their policy&#x2019;s\nconsequences, i.e., the greater the spread of misery, of injustice, of vicious\ninequality throughout the world, the more frantic their pursuit&#x2014;which is one\ndemonstration of the fact that there is no such thing as a benevolent passion\nfor equality and that the claim to it is only a rationalization to cover a\npassionate hatred of the good for being the good.",
