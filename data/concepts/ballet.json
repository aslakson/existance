      "content": "The keynote of the stylization achieved in ballet is: weightlessness.\nParadoxically, ballet presents man as almost disembodied: it does not distort\nman&#x2019;s body, it selects the kinds of movements that are normally possible to man\n(such as walking on tiptoe) and exaggerates them, stressing their beauty&#x2014;and\ndefying the law of gravitation. A gracefully effortless floating, flowing and\nflying are the essentials of the ballet&#x2019;s image of man. It projects a fragile\nkind of strength and a certain inflexible precision, but it is man with a fine\nsteel skeleton and without flesh, man the spirit, not controlling, but\ntranscending this earth .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",
