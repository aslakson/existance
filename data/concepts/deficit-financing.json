To free itself&#x2014;for a while&#x2014;from the limits set by reality, the\ngovernment initiates a credit con game on a scale which the private manipulator\ncould not dream of. It borrows money from you today, which is to be repaid with\nmoney it will borrow from you tomorrow, which is to be repaid with money it\nwill borrow from you day after tomorrow, and so on. This is known as &#x201C;deficit\nfinancing.&#x201D; It is made possible by the fact that the government cuts the\nconnection between goods and money. It issues paper money, which is used as a\nclaim check on actually existing goods&#x2014;but that money is not backed by any\ngoods, it is not backed by gold, it is backed by nothing. It is a promissory\nnote issued to you in exchange for your goods, to be paid by you (in the form\nof taxes) out of your future production.",
