By &#x201C;moral values&#x201D; I mean values which\nare volitionally chosen, and which are fundamental, i.e., shape the whole\ncourse of a man&#x2019;s action, not merely a specialized, delimited area of his life\n.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. So a man&#x2019;s character is, in effect, his moral essence&#x2014;his self-made\nidentity as expressed in the principles he lives by.",

      "content": "Just as man&#x2019;s physical survival depends on his own effort, so does his\npsychological survival.  Man faces two corollary, interdependent fields of\naction in which a constant exercise of choice and a constant creative process\nare demanded of him: the world around him and his own soul (by &#x201C;soul,&#x201D; I mean\nhis consciousness).  Just as he has to produce the material values he needs to\nsustain his life, so he has to acquire the values of character that enable him\nto sustain it and that make his life worth living.  He is born without the\nknowledge of either.  He has to discover both&#x2014;and translate them into\nreality&#x2014;and survive by shaping the world and himself in the image of his\nvalues.",
