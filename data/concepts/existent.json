Since it is a\nconcept, man cannot grasp it explicitly until he has reached the conceptual\nstage. But it is implicit in every percept (to perceive a thing is to perceive\nthat it exists) and man grasps it implicitly on the perceptual level&#x2014;i.e., he\ngrasps the constituents of the concept &#x201C;existent,&#x201D; the data which are later to\nbe integrated by that concept. It is this implicit knowledge that permits his\nconsciousness to develop further.",
