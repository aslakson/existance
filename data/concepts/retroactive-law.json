It is specifically forbidden by the United States\nConstitution. It is not supposed to exist in the United States and it is not\napplied to anyone&#x2014;except to businessmen. A case in which a man cannot know\nuntil he is convicted whether the action he took in the past was legal or\nillegal, is certainly a case of retroactive law.",
