      "content": "There is an element of grim irony in the emergence of Linguistic Analysis on\nthe philosophical scene. The assault on man&#x2019;s conceptual faculty has been\naccelerating since Kant, widening the breach between man&#x2019;s mind and reality.\nThe cognitive function of concepts was undercut by a series of grotesque\ndevices&#x2014;such, for instance, as the &#x201C;analytic-synthetic&#x201D; dichotomy which,\nby a route of tortuous circumlocutions and equivocations, leads to the dogma\nthat a &#x201C;necessarily&#x201D; true proposition cannot be factual, and a factual\nproposition cannot be &#x201C;necessarily&#x201D; true. The crass skepticism and\nepistemological cynicism of Kant&#x2019;s influence have been seeping from the\nuniversities to the arts, the sciences, the industries, the legislatures,\nsaturating our culture, decomposing language and thought. If ever there was a\nneed for a Herculean philosophical effort to clean up the Kantian\nstables&#x2014;particularly, to redeem language by establishing objective criteria of\nmeaning and definition, which average men could not attempt&#x2014;the time was\n<em>now</em>. As if sensing that need, Linguistic Analysis came on the scene for the\navowed purpose of &#x201C;clarifying&#x201D; language&#x2014;and proceeded to declare that the\nmeaning of concepts is determined in the minds of average men, and that the job\nof philosophers consists of observing and reporting on how people use words.",

Linguistic Analysis is vehemently opposed to .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. any\nkinds of principles or broad generalizations&#x2014;i.e., to consistency. It is\nopposed to basic axioms (as &#x201C;analytic&#x201D; and &#x201C;redundant&#x201D;)&#x2014;i.e., to the necessity\nof any grounds for one&#x2019;s assertions.  It is opposed to the hierarchical\nstructure of concepts (i.e., to the process of abstraction) and regards any\nword as an isolated primary (i.e., as a perceptually given concrete). It is\nopposed to &#x201C;system-building&#x201D;&#x2014;i.e., to the integration of knowledge.",

      "content": "It is the claim of Linguistic Analysis that its purpose is not the\ncommunication of any particular philosophic content, but the <em>training</em>\nof a student&#x2019;s mind. This is true&#x2014;in the terrible, butchering sense of a\ncomprachico operation. The detailed discussions of inconsequential\nminutiae&#x2014;the discourses on trivia picked at random and in midstream,\nwithout base, context or conclusion&#x2014;the shocks of self-doubt at the\nprofessor&#x2019;s sudden revelations of some such fact as the student&#x2019;s inability to\ndefine the word &#x201C;but,&#x201D; which, he claims, proves that they do not understand\ntheir own statements&#x2014;the countering of the question: &#x201C;What is the meaning\nof philosophy?&#x201D; with: &#x201C;Which sense of &#x2018;meaning&#x2019; do you mean?&#x201D; followed by a\ndiscourse on twelve possible uses of the word &#x201C;meaning,&#x201D; by which time the\nquestion is lost&#x2014;and, above all, the necessity to shrink one&#x2019;s focus to\nthe range of a flea&#x2019;s, and to keep it there&#x2014;will cripple the best of\nminds, if it attempts to comply.",
