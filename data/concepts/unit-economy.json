      "content": "Since consciousness is a specific faculty, it has a specific nature or identity\nand, therefore, its range is limited: it cannot perceive everything at once;\nsince awareness, on all its levels, requires an active process, it cannot do\neverything at once. Whether the units with which one deals are percepts or\nconcepts, the range of what man can hold in the focus of his conscious\nawareness at any given moment, is limited. The essence, therefore, of man&#x2019;s\nincomparable cognitive power is the ability to reduce a vast amount of\ninformation to a minimal number of units&#x2014;which is the task performed by his\nconceptual faculty. And the principle of <em>unit-economy</em> is one of that\nfaculty&#x2019;s essential guiding principles.",

The range\nof man&#x2019;s perceptual awareness&#x2014;the number of percepts he can deal with at any\none time&#x2014;is limited. He may be able to visualize four or five units&#x2014;as, for\ninstance, five trees. He cannot visualize a hundred trees or a distance of ten\nlight-years. It is only his conceptual faculty that makes it possible for him\nto deal with knowledge of that kind.",
