For example, any\ndeparture in metaphysics from the view that this world in which we live is\nreality, the full, final, absolute reality&#x2014;any such departure will\nnecessarily undercut a man&#x2019;s confidence in his ability to deal with the world,\nand thus will inject the malevolent-universe element. The same applies in\nepistemology: if you conclude in any form that reason is not valid, then man\nhas no tool of achieving values; so defeat and tragedy are unavoidable.",
