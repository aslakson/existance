The doctrine that &#x201C;human rights&#x201D; are\nsuperior to &#x201C;property rights&#x201D; simply means that some human beings have the\nright to make property out of others; since the competent have nothing to gain\nfrom the incompetent, it means the right of the incompetent to own their\nbetters and to use them as productive cattle. Whoever regards this as human and\nright, has no right to the title of &#x201C;human.&#x201D;",

Since material goods are produced by\nthe mind and effort of individual men, and are needed to sustain their lives,\nif the producer does not own the result of his effort, he does not own his\nlife. To deny property rights means to turn men into property owned by the\nstate. Whoever claims the &#x201C;right&#x201D; to &#x201C;redistribute&#x201D; the wealth produced by\nothers is claiming the &#x201C;right&#x201D; to treat human beings as chattel.",
