When he\ndenounces &#x201C;Big Government,&#x201D; it is not the unlimited, arbitrary power of the\nstate that he is denouncing, but merely its centralization&#x2014;and he seeks to\nplace the same unlimited, arbitrary power in the hands of many little\ngovernments. The break-up of a big gang into a number of warring small gangs is\nnot a return to a constitutional system nor to individual rights nor to law and\norder.",
