But the philosophical systems\nbased on the primacy of consciousness (i.e., on the seemingly megalomaniacal\nnotion that nature is whatever man wants it to be) lead to the view that man\npossesses no identity, that he is infinitely flexible, malleable, usable and\ndisposable.  Ask yourself why.",

What they achieve is the opposite of their\ndesire.  They want an omnipotent power over existence; instead, they lose the\npower of their consciousness.  By refusing to know, they condemn themselves to\nthe horror of a perpetual unknown.",

      "content": "It is important to observe the interrelation of these three axioms [existence,\nconsciousness, and identity].  Existence is the first axiom.  <em>The universe\nexists independent of consciousness</em>.  Man is able to adapt his background to\nhis own requirements, but &#x201C;Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed&#x201D; (Francis\nBacon).  There is no mental process that can change the laws of nature or erase\nfacts.  The function of consciousness is not to create reality, but to\napprehend it.  &#x201C;Existence is Identity, Consciousness is Identification.&#x201D;",
