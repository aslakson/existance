When one deals with irrational\npersons, where argument is futile, a mere &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t agree with you&#x201D; is\nsufficient to negate any implication of moral sanction. When one deals with\nbetter people, a full statement of one&#x2019;s views may be morally required. But in\nno case and in no situation may one permit one&#x2019;s own values to be attacked or\ndenounced, and keep silent.",
