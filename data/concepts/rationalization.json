      "content": "Since an emotion is experienced as an immediate primary, but is, in fact, a\ncomplex, derivative sum, it permits men to practice one of the ugliest of\npsychological phenomena: <em>rationalization</em>. Rationalization is a cover-up, a\nprocess of providing one&#x2019;s emotions with a false identity, of giving them\nspurious explanations and justifications&#x2014;in order to hide one&#x2019;s motives, not\njust from others, but primarily from oneself. The price of rationalizing is the\nhampering, the distortion and, ultimately, the destruction of one&#x2019;s cognitive\nfaculty. Rationalization is a process not of perceiving reality, but of\nattempting to make reality fit one&#x2019;s emotions.",
