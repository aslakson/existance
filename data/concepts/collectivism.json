Collectivism maintains that an elite endowed with\nspecial mystic insight should rule men&#x2014;which implies the existence of an elite\nsource of knowledge, a fund of revelations inaccessible to logic and\ntranscending the mind.  Collectivism denies that men should deal with one\nanother by voluntary means, settling their disputes by a process of rational\npersuasion; it declares that men should live under the reign of physical force\n(as wielded by the dictator of the omnipotent state)&#x2014;a position which\njettisons reason as the guide and arbiter of human relationships.",
