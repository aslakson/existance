To form a concept, one mentally <em>isolates</em> a group of concretes\n(of distinct perceptual units), on the basis of observed similarities which\ndistinguish them from all other known concretes (similarity is &#x201C;the\nrelationship between two or more existents which possess the same\ncharacteristic(s), but in different measure or degree&#x201D;); then, by a process\nof omitting the particular measurements of these concretes, one <em>integrates</em>\nthem into a single new mental unit: the concept, which subsumes all concretes\nof this kind (a potentially unlimited number).  The integration is completed\nand retained by the selection of a perceptual symbol (a word) to designate it.\n&#x201C;A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the same\ndistinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted.&#x201D;",

The <em>difference is one of measurement</em>.  In order to form the\nconcept &#x201C;length,&#x201D; the child&#x2019;s mind retains the attribute and omits its\nparticular measurements.  Or, more precisely, if the process were identified in\nwords, it would consist of the following: &#x201C;Length must exist in <em>some</em>\nquantity, but may exist in <em>any</em> quantity.  I shall identify as &#x2018;length&#x2019; that\nattribute of any existent possessing it which can be quantitatively related to\na unit of length, without specifying the quantity.&#x201D;",
