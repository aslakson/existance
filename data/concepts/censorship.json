No private individual or agency can silence a man or\nsuppress a publication; only the government can do so. The freedom of speech of\nprivate individuals includes the right not to agree, not to listen and not to\nfinance one&#x2019;s own antagonists.",

      "content": "Censorship, in its old-fashioned meaning, is a government edict that forbids\nthe discussion of some specific subjects or ideas&#x2014;such, for instance, as sex,\nreligion or criticism of government officials&#x2014;an edict enforced by the\ngovernment&#x2019;s scrutiny of all forms of communication prior to their public\nrelease. But for stifling the freedom of men&#x2019;s minds the modern method is much\nmore potent; it rests on the power of nonobjective law; it neither forbids nor\npermits anything; it never defines or specifies; it merely delivers men&#x2019;s\nlives, fortunes, careers, ambitions into the arbitrary power of a bureaucrat\nwho can reward or punish at whim. It spares the bureaucrat the troublesome\nnecessity of committing himself to rigid rules&#x2014;and it places upon the victims\nthe burden of discovering how to please him, with a fluid unknowable as their\nonly guide.",
