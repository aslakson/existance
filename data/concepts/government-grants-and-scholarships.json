      "content": "The fundamental evil of government grants is the fact that men are forced to\npay for the support of ideas diametrically opposed to their own. This is a\nprofound violation of an individual&#x2019;s integrity and conscience. It is viciously\nwrong to take the money of rational men for the support of B.F. Skinner&#x2014;or\nvice versa. The Constitution forbids a governmental establishment of religion,\nproperly regarding it as a violation of individual rights. Since a man&#x2019;s\nbeliefs are protected from the intrusion of force, the same principle should\nprotect his reasoned convictions and forbid governmental establishments in the\nfield of thought.",

      "content": "How would Washington bureaucrats&#x2014;or Congressmen, for that matter&#x2014;know which\nscientist to encourage, particularly in so controversial a field as social\nscience? The safest method is to choose men who have achieved some sort of\nreputation. Whether their reputation is deserved or not, whether their\nachievements are valid or not, whether they rose by merit, pull, publicity or\naccident, are questions which the awarders do not and cannot consider. When\npersonal judgment is inoperative (or forbidden), men&#x2019;s first concern is not how\nto choose, but how to justify their choice. This will necessarily prompt\ncommittee members, bureaucrats and politicians to gravitate toward &#x201C;prestigious\nnames.&#x201D; The result is to help establish those already established&#x2014;i.e., to\nentrench the status quo.",
