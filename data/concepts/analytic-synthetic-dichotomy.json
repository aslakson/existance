      "content": "The assault on man&#x2019;s conceptual faculty has been accelerating since Kant,\nwidening the breach between man&#x2019;s mind and reality.  The cognitive function of\nconcepts was undercut by a series of grotesque devices&#x2014;such, for instance, as\nthe &#x201C;analytic-synthetic&#x201D; dichotomy which, by a route of tortuous\ncircumlocutions and equivocations, leads to the dogma that a &#x201C;necessarily&#x201D; true\nproposition cannot be factual, and a factual proposition cannot be\n&#x201C;necessarily&#x201D; true.",

The epistemological error,\nas I have discussed, is an incorrect view of the nature of concepts.  The\nmetaphysical error is: the dichotomy between necessary and contingent facts.",

Historically, that term has been used to designate a metaphysical\ncategory of much wider scope than the realm of human action; and it has always\nbeen associated with a metaphysics which, in one form or another, denies the\nfacts of Identity and Causality.  The &#x201C;necessary-contingent&#x201D; terminology serves\nonly to introduce confusion, and should be abandoned.  What is required in this\ncontext is the distinction between the &#x201C;metaphysical&#x201D; and the &#x201C;man-made.&#x201D; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\nTruths about metaphysical and about man-made facts are learned and validated by\nthe same process: by observation; and, <em>qua truths</em>, both are equally\nnecessary.  Some <em>facts</em> are not necessary, but all <em>truths</em> are.",
