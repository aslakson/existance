      "content": "A man who has psychological problems is a conscious being; his cognitive\nfaculty is hampered, burdened, slowed down, but not destroyed. A neurotic is\nnot a psychotic. Only a psychotic is presumed to suffer from a total break with\nreality and to have no control over his actions or the operations of his\nconsciousness (and even this is not always true). A neurotic retains the\nability to perceive reality, and to control his consciousness and his actions\n(this control is merely more difficult for him than for a healthy person). So\nlong as he is not psychotic, this is the control that a man <em>cannot</em> lose and\n<em>must not</em> abdicate.",
