Values are a necessity of man&#x2019;s survival, and wider: of any\nliving organism&#x2019;s survival. Life is a process of self-sustaining and\nself-generated action, and the successful pursuit of values is a precondition\nof remaining alive. Since nature does not provide man with an automatic\nknowledge of the code of values he requires, there are differences in the codes\nwhich men accept and the goals they pursue. But consider the abstraction\n&#x201C;value,&#x201D; apart from the particular content of any given code, and ask yourself:\nWhat is the nature of a creature in which the sight of a value arouses hatred\nand the desire to destroy? In the most profound sense of the term, such a\ncreature is a killer, not a physical, but a metaphysical one&#x2014;it is not an\nenemy of <em>your</em> values, but of <em>all</em> values, it is an enemy of anything that\nenables men to survive, it is an enemy of life as such and of everything\nliving.",

It is not your wealth that\nthey&#x2019;re after. Theirs is a conspiracy against the mind, which means: against\nlife and man.",
