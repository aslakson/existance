      "content": "Now a word of warning about the criteria of esthetic judgment. A sense of life\nis the source of art, but it is not the sole qualification of an artist or of\nan esthetician, and it is not a criterion of esthetic judgment. Emotions are\n<em>not</em> tools of cognition. Esthetics is a branch of philosophy&#x2014;and just as a\nphilosopher does <em>not</em> approach any other branch of his science with his\nfeelings or emotions as his criterion of judgment, so he cannot do it in the\nfield of esthetics. A sense of life is not sufficient professional equipment.\nAn esthetician&#x2014;as well as any man who attempts to evaluate art works&#x2014;must be\nguided by more than an emotion.",
