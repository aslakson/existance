A\ndictatorship is a gang devoted to looting the effort of the productive citizens\nof its own country. When a statist ruler exhausts his own country&#x2019;s economy, he\nattacks his neighbors. It is his only means of postponing internal collapse and\nprolonging his rule. A country that violates the rights of its own citizens,\nwill not respect the rights of its neighbors. Those who do not recognize\nindividual rights, will not recognize the rights of nations: a nation is only a\nnumber of individuals.",
