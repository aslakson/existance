      "content": "The notion of racial quotas is so obviously an expression of racism that no\nlengthy discussion is necessary. If a young man is barred from a school or a\njob because the quota for his particular race has been filled, he is barred by\nreason of his race. Telling him that those admitted are his &#x201C;representatives,&#x201D;\nis adding insult to injury. To demand such quotas in the name of fighting\nracial discrimination, is an obscene mockery.",

Assuming a total merging of the self with the group,\nthe doctrine holds that it makes no difference to a man whether <em>he</em> or his\n&#x201C;representative&#x201D; is admitted to a school, gets a job, or makes a decision.",

Racism is an evil, irrational and morally contemptible doctrine&#x2014;but\ndoctrines cannot be forbidden or prescribed by law. Just as we have to protect\na communist&#x2019;s freedom of speech, even though his doctrines are evil, so we have\nto protect a racist&#x2019;s right to the use and disposal of his own property.\nPrivate racism is not a legal, but a moral issue&#x2014;and can be fought only by\nprivate means, such as economic boycott or social ostracism.",
