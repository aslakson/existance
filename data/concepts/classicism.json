In literature, these rules consisted of specific edicts,\nloosely derived from the Greek (and French) tragedies, which prescribed every\nformal aspect of a play (such as the unity of time, place and action) down to\nthe number of acts and the number of verses permitted to a character in every\nact. Some of that stuff was based on Aristotle&#x2019;s esthetics and can serve as an\nexample of what happens when concrete-bound mentalities, seeking to by-pass the\nresponsibility of thought, attempt to transform abstract principles into\nconcrete prescriptions and to replace creation with imitation. (For an example\nof Classicism that survived well into the twentieth century, I refer you to the\narchitectural dogmas represented by Howard Roark&#x2019;s antagonists in\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/the-fountainhead.html\"><cite>The Fountainhead</cite></a>.",
