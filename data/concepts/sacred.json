It is a radiant look of\njoy, of liberation, almost of triumph, which is unself-conscious, yet\nself-assertive, and its radiance seems to spread in two directions: outward, as\nan illumination of the world&#x2014;inward, as the first spark of what is to become\nthe fire of an earned pride. If you have seen this look, or experienced it, you\nknow that if there is such a concept as &#x201C;sacred&#x201D;&#x2014;meaning: the best, the\nhighest possible to man&#x2014;this look is the sacred, the not-to-be-betrayed, the\nnot-to-be-sacrificed for anything or anyone.",
