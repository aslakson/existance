      "content": "As far as the issue of actual pollution is concerned, it is primarily a\nscientific, not a political, problem. In regard to the political principle\ninvolved: if a man creates a physical danger or harm to others, which extends\nbeyond the line of his own property, such as unsanitary conditions or even loud\nnoise, and if this is proved, the law can and does hold him responsible. If the\ncondition is collective, such as in an overcrowded city, appropriate and\nobjective laws can be defined, protecting the rights of all those involved&#x2014;as\nwas done in the case of oil rights, air-space rights, etc. But such laws cannot\ndemand the impossible, must not be aimed at a single scapegoat, i.e.,\nthe industrialists, and must take into consideration the whole context of the\nproblem, i.e., the absolute necessity of the continued existence of\nindustry&#x2014;if the preservation of human life is the standard.",
