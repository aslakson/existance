The error lies in assuming that a concept consists of nothing but its\ndistinguishing characteristic. But the fact is that in the process of\nabstracting from abstractions, one cannot know <em>what</em> is a distinguishing\ncharacteristic unless one has observed other characteristics of the units\ninvolved and of the existents from which they are differentiated.",
