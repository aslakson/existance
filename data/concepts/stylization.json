He selects those aspects of\nexistence which he regards as metaphysically significant&#x2014;and by isolating and\nstressing them, by omitting the insignificant and accidental, he presents <em>his</em>\nview of existence. His concepts are not divorced from the facts of\nreality&#x2014;they are concepts which integrate the facts <em>and</em> his metaphysical\nevaluation of the facts.",
