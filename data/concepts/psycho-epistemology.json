Man&#x2019;s conscious mind observes and\nestablishes connections among his experiences; the subconscious integrates the\nconnections and makes them become automatic. For example, the skill of walking\nis acquired, after many faltering attempts, by the automatization of countless\nconnections controlling muscular movements; once he learns to walk, a child\nneeds no conscious awareness of such problems as posture, balance, length of\nstep, etc.&#x2014;the mere decision to walk brings the integrated total into his\ncontrol.",

Yet\nthis kind of ignorance can be disastrous.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Men can automatize wrong methods\nof thought without even knowing it. In order to achieve intellectual control,\ntherefore, in order to enjoy the full power over your mind that volition makes\npossible, you must identify your psycho-epistemological methods, and correct\nthose, if any, which are not consonant with your adult knowledge.",
