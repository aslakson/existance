It is\nthe doctrine which holds that man&#x2014;an entity of a specific nature, dealing with\na universe of a specific nature&#x2014;can, somehow, live, act and achieve his goals\napart from and/or in contradiction to the facts of reality, i.e., apart from\nand/or in contradiction to his own nature and the nature of the universe. (This\nis the &#x201C;mixed,&#x201D; moderate or middle-of-the-road version of subjectivism. Pure or\n&#x201C;extreme&#x201D; subjectivism does not recognize the concept of identity, i.e., the\nfact that man or the universe or anything possesses a specific nature.)",

In epistemology, as a result,\nsubjectivists hold that a man need not concern himself with the facts of\nreality; instead, to arrive at knowledge or truth, he need merely turn his\nattention inward, consulting the appropriate contents of consciousness, the\nones with the power to make reality conform to their dictates. According to the\nmost widespread form of subjectivism, the elements which possess this power are\n<em>feelings</em>.",

On his view, truth\nvaries from consciousness to consciousness as the processes or contents of\nconsciousness vary; the same statement may be true for one consciousness (or\none type of consciousness) and false for another. The virtually infallible sign\nof the subjectivist is his refusal to say, of a statement he accepts: &#x201C;It is\ntrue&#x201D;; instead, he says: &#x201C;It is true&#x2014;for me (or <em>for us</em>).&#x201D; There is no truth,\nonly truth relative to an individual or a group&#x2014;truth for me, for you, for\nhim, for her, for us, for them.",

They take their\nemotions as a cause, and their mind as a passive effect.  They make their\nemotions their tool for perceiving reality.  They hold their desires as an\nirreducible primary, as a fact superseding all facts.  An honest man does not\ndesire until he has identified the object of his desire.

      "content": "There are two different kinds of subjectivism, distinguished by their answers\nto the question: <em>whose</em> consciousness creates reality?  Kant rejected the\nolder of these two, which was the view that each man&#x2019;s feelings create a\nprivate universe for him.  Instead, Kant ushered in the era of <em>social</em>\nsubjectivism&#x2014;the view that it is not the consciousness of individuals, but of\n<em>groups</em>, that creates reality.  In Kant&#x2019;s system, mankind as a whole is the\ndecisive group; what creates the phenomenal world is not the idiosyncrasies of\nparticular individuals, but the mental structure common to all men.",
