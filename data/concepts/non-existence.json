(One can\narrive at the concept &#x201C;absence&#x201D; starting from the concept &#x201C;presence,&#x201D; in regard\nto some particular existent(s); one cannot arrive at the concept &#x201C;presence&#x201D;\nstarting from the concept &#x201C;absence,&#x201D; with the absence including everything.)\nNon-existence as such is a zero with no sequence of numbers to follow it, it is\nthe nothing, the total blank.",
