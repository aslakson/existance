As an example of philosophy&#x2019;s function,\npolitical philosophy will not tell you how much rationed gas you should be\ngiven and on which day of the week&#x2014;it will tell you whether the government has\nthe right to impose any rationing on anything.",

For decades, this issue has been\nsilenced, suppressed, evaded, and hidden under the foggy, undefined\nrubber-terms of &#x201C;conservatism&#x201D; and &#x201C;liberalism&#x201D; which had lost their original\nmeaning and could be stretched to mean all things to all men.",

      "content": "Politics is based on three other philosophical disciplines: metaphysics,\nepistemology and ethics&#x2014;on a theory of man&#x2019;s nature and of man&#x2019;s relationship\nto existence. It is only on such a base that one can formulate a consistent\npolitical theory and achieve it in practice. When, however, men attempt to rush\ninto politics without such a base, the result is that embarrassing\nconglomeration of impotence, futility, inconsistency and superficiality which\nis loosely designated today as &#x201C;conservatism.&#x201D; Objectivists are not\n&#x201C;conservatives.&#x201D; We are <em>radicals for capitalism</em>; we are fighting for that\nphilosophical base which capitalism did not have and without which it was\ndoomed to perish.",

No man&#x2014;or group or\nsociety or government&#x2014;has the right to assume the role of a criminal and\ninitiate the use of physical compulsion against any man. Men have the right to\nuse physical force <em>only</em> in retaliation and <em>only</em> against those who initiate\nits use.",
