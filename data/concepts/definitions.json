The units of a concept were differentiated&#x2014;by means of a\ndistinguishing characteristic(s)&#x2014;from other existents possessing a\ncommensurable characteristic, a Conceptual Common Denominator. A definition\nfollows the same principle: it specifies the distinguishing characteristic(s)\nof the units, and indicates the category of existents from which they were\ndifferentiated.",

For example, if he is considering some social theory and recalls\nthat &#x201C;man is a rational animal,&#x201D; he will evaluate the validity of the theory\naccordingly; but if, instead, he recalls that &#x201C;man is an animal possessing a\nthumb,&#x201D; his evaluation and conclusion will be quite different.",
