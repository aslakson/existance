It is by means of such chains that man has to acquire and\nretain his knowledge of reality.",

Following the\nprocess and in accordance with cognitive evidence, earlier-formed concepts are\nintegrated into wider ones or subdivided into narrower ones.",

There is no such\nperceptual object as &#x201C;furniture&#x201D;; there are only tables, chairs, beds, etc. The\nmeaning of &#x201C;furniture&#x201D; cannot be grasped unless one has first grasped the\nmeaning of its constituent concepts; these are its link to reality. (On the\nlower levels of an unlimited conceptual chain, this is an illustration of the\nhierarchical structure of concepts.)",
