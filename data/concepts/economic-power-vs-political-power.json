      "content": "A disastrous intellectual package-deal, put over on us by the theoreticians of\nstatism, is the equation of <em>economic</em> power with <em>political</em> power. You have\nheard it expressed in such bromides as: &#x201C;A hungry man is not free,&#x201D; or &#x201C;It\nmakes no difference to a worker whether he takes orders from a businessman or\nfrom a bureaucrat.&#x201D; Most people accept these equivocations&#x2014;and yet they know\nthat the poorest laborer in America is freer and more secure than the richest\ncommissar in Soviet Russia. What is the basic, the essential, the crucial\nprinciple that differentiates freedom from slavery? It is the principle of\nvoluntary action <em>versus</em> physical coercion or compulsion.",

      "content": "What is economic power? It is the power to produce and to trade what one has\nproduced. In a free economy, where no man or group of men can use physical\ncoercion against anyone, economic power can be achieved only by <em>voluntary</em>\nmeans: by the voluntary choice and agreement of all those who participate in\nthe process of production and trade. In a free market, all prices, wages, and\nprofits are determined&#x2014;not by the arbitrary whim of the rich or of the poor,\nnot by anyone&#x2019;s &#x201C;greed&#x201D; or by anyone&#x2019;s need&#x2014;but by the law of supply and\ndemand. The mechanism of a free market reflects and sums up all the economic\nchoices and decisions made by all the participants. Men trade their goods or\nservices by mutual consent to mutual advantage, according to their own\nindependent, uncoerced judgment. A man can grow rich only if he is able to\noffer better values&#x2014;better products or services, at a lower price&#x2014;than others\nare able to offer.",

Evading the difference between trade and\nforce, they called him a tyrant. The most crucial issue they had to evade was\nthe difference between the <em>earned</em> and the <em>unearned</em>.",
