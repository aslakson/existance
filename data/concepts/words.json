This is\nthe function performed by language. Language is a code of visual-auditory\nsymbols that serves the psycho-epistemological function of converting concepts\ninto the mental equivalent of concretes. Language is the exclusive domain and\ntool of concepts. Every word we use (with the exception of proper names) is a\nsymbol that denotes a concept, i.e., that stands for an unlimited number of\nconcretes of a certain kind.",

Observe that the visual form he gives\nthem is reduced to those <em>essentials</em> which distinguish the particular kind of\nentities from all others&#x2014;for instance, the universal type of a child&#x2019;s drawing\nof man in the form of an oval for the torso, a circle for the head, four sticks\nfor extremities, etc. Such drawings are a visual record of the process of\nabstraction and concept-formation in a mind&#x2019;s transition from the perceptual\nlevel to the full vocabulary of the conceptual level.",

The\nfirst concepts a child forms are concepts of perceptual entities; the first\nwords he learns are words designating them. Even though a child does not have\nto perform the feat of genius performed by some mind or minds in the\nprehistorical infancy of the human race: the invention of language&#x2014;every child\nhas to perform independently the feat of grasping the nature of language, the\nprocess of symbolizing concepts by means of words.",
