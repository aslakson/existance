Discard the\nprotective rags of that vice which you call a virtue: humility&#x2014;learn to value\nyourself, which means: to fight for your happiness&#x2014;and when you learn that\n<em>pride</em> is the sum of all virtues, you will learn to live like a man.",

The man who is willing to serve as the means to the\nends of others, will necessarily regard others as the means to <em>his</em> ends.",

If a man has acted immorally, but\nregrets it and wants to atone for it, it is not self-abasement that prompts\nhim, but some remnant of love for moral values&#x2014;and it is not self-abasement\nthat he expresses, but a longing to regain his self-esteem. Humility is not a\nrecognition of one&#x2019;s failings, but a rejection of morality. &#x201C;I am no good&#x201D; is a\nstatement that may be uttered only in the past tense. To say: &#x201C;I am no good&#x201D; is\nto declare: &#x201C;&#x2014;and I never intend to be any better.&#x201D;",
