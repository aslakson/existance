Purchasing\npower is a consequence of production: it is the power of possessing goods which\none can trade for other goods. A &#x201C;<em>purchase</em>&#x201D; is an exchange of goods (or\nservices) for goods (or services). Any other form of transferring goods from\none person to another may belong to many different categories of transactions,\nbut it is <em>not a purchase</em>. It may be a gift, a loan, an inheritance, a\nhandout, a fraud, a theft, a robbery, a burglary, an expropriation. In regard\nto services, however (omitting temporary or occasional acts of friendship, in\nwhich the payment is the friend&#x2019;s value), there is only one alternative to\ntrading: unpaid services, i.e., slavery.",
