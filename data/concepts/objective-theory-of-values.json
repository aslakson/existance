Since values are to be discovered by man&#x2019;s mind, men must be free to\ndiscover them&#x2014;to think, to study, to translate their knowledge into physical\nform, to offer their products for trade, to judge them, and to choose, be it\nmaterial goods or ideas, a loaf of bread or a philosophical treatise. Since\nvalues are established contextually, every man must judge for himself, in the\ncontext of his own knowledge, goals, and interests. Since values are determined\nby the nature of reality, it is reality that serves as men&#x2019;s ultimate arbiter:\nif a man&#x2019;s judgment is right, the rewards are his; if it is wrong, he is his\nonly victim.",
