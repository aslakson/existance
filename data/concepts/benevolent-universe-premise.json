On the contrary, the achievement of\nvalues is the norm&#x2014;speaking now for the moral man, moral by the Objectivist\ndefinition. Success and happiness are the metaphysically to-be-expected. In\nother words, Objectivism rejects the view that human fulfillment is impossible,\nthat man is doomed to misery, that the universe is malevolent. We advocate the\n&#x201C;benevolent universe&#x201D; premise.",
