A cynic is one who believes that men are\ninnately depraved, that irrationality and cowardice are their basic\ncharacteristics, that fear is the most potent of human incentives&#x2014;and,\ntherefore, that the most practical method of dealing with men is to count on\ntheir stupidity, appeal to their knavery, and keep them in constant terror.",
