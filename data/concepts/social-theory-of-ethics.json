      "content": "The social theory of ethics substitutes &#x201C;society&#x201D; for God&#x2014;and although it\nclaims that its chief concern is life on earth, it is <em>not</em> the life of man,\nnot the life of an individual, but the life of a disembodied entity, <em>the\ncollective</em>, which, in relation to every individual, consists of everybody\nexcept himself. As far as the individual is concerned, <em>his</em> ethical duty is to\nbe the selfless, voiceless, rightless slave of any need, claim or demand\nasserted by others. The motto &#x201C;dog eat dog&#x201D;&#x2014;which is <em>not</em> applicable to\ncapitalism nor to dogs&#x2014;is applicable to the social theory of ethics. The\nexistential monuments to <em>this</em> theory are Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.",

      "content": "The avowed mystics held the arbitrary, unaccountable &#x201C;will of God&#x201D; as the\nstandard of the good and as the validation of their ethics. The neomystics\nreplaced it with &#x201C;the good of society,&#x201D; thus collapsing into the circularity of\na definition such as &#x201C;the standard of the good is that which is good for\nsociety.&#x201D; This meant, in logic&#x2014;and, today, in worldwide practice&#x2014;that\n&#x201C;society&#x201D; stands above any principles of ethics, since <em>it</em> is the source,\nstandard and criterion of ethics, since &#x201C;the good&#x201D; is whatever <em>it</em> wills,\nwhatever <em>it</em> happens to assert as its own welfare and pleasure. This meant\nthat &#x201C;society&#x201D; may do anything it pleases, since &#x201C;the good&#x201D; is whatever it\nchooses to do <em>because</em> it chooses to do it. And&#x2014;since there is no such entity\nas &#x201C;society,&#x201D; since society is only a number of individual men&#x2014;this meant that\n<em>some</em> men (the majority or any gang that claims to be its spokesman) are\nethically entitled to pursue any whims (or any atrocities) they desire to\npursue, while <em>other</em> men are ethically obliged to spend their lives in the\nservice of that gang&#x2019;s desires.",
