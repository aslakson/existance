      "content": "As far as metaphysical reality is concerned (omitting human actions from\nconsideration, for the moment), there are no &#x201C;facts which happen to be but\ncould have been otherwise&#x201D; as against &#x201C;facts which must be.&#x201D; There are only:\nfacts which <em>are</em>.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Since things are what they are, since everything\nthat exists possesses a specific identity, nothing in reality can occur\ncauselessly or by chance. The nature of an entity determines what it can do\nand, in any given set of circumstances, dictates what it <em>will</em> do.  The Law of\nCausality is entailed by the Law of Identity. Entities follow certain laws of\naction in consequence of their identity, and have no alternative to doing so.\nMetaphysically, all facts are inherent in the identities of the entities that\nexist; i.e., all facts are &#x201C;necessary.&#x201D; In this sense, to be <em>is</em> to be\n&#x201C;necessary.&#x201D; The concept of &#x201C;necessity,&#x201D; in a metaphysical context, is\nsuperfluous.",

      "content": "A typical package-deal, used by professors of philosophy, runs as follows: to\nprove the assertion that there is no such thing as &#x201C;necessity&#x201D; in the universe,\na professor declares that just as this country did not <em>have</em> to have fifty\nstates, there could have been forty-eight or fifty-two&#x2014;so the solar system did\nnot <em>have to</em> have nine planets, there could have been seven or eleven. It is\nnot sufficient, he declares, to prove that something <em>is</em>, one must also prove\nthat it <em>had to</em> be&#x2014;and since nothing had to be, nothing is certain and\nanything goes.",
