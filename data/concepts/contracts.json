If\na contract is broken by the arbitrary decision of one man, it may cause a\ndisastrous financial injury to the other .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. This leads to one of the most\nimportant and most complex functions of the government: to the function of an\narbiter who settles disputes among men according to objective laws.",
