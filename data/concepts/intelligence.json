It has to be acquired by a child&#x2019;s own effort and automatized by his own\nmind, but adults can help or hinder him in this crucial process.",

Intelligence is the ability to grasp the\nfacts of reality and to deal with them long-range (i.e., conceptually). On the\naxiom of the primacy of existence, intelligence is man&#x2019;s most precious\nattribute. But it has no place in a society ruled by the primacy of\nconsciousness: it is such a society&#x2019;s deadliest enemy.",

If conditions of\nexistence are destructive to genius, they are destructive to every man, each in\nproportion to his intelligence. If genius is penalized, so is the faculty of\nintelligence in every other man. There is only this difference: the average man\ndoes not possess the genius&#x2019;s power of self-confident resistance, and will\nbreak much faster; he will give up his mind, in hopeless bewilderment, under\nthe first touch of pressure.",
