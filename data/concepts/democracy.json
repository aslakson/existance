Who is the majority?  In\nrelation to each particular man, all other men are potential members of that\nmajority which may destroy him at its pleasure at any moment.  Then each man\nand all men become enemies; each has to fear and suspect all; each must try to\nrob and murder first, before he is robbed and murdered.",

A\ndemocracy, if you attach meaning to terms, is a system of unlimited majority\nrule; the classic example is ancient Athens.  And the symbol of it is the fate\nof Socrates, who was put to death legally, because the majority didn&#x2019;t like\nwhat he was saying, although he had initiated no force and had violated no\none&#x2019;s rights.",
