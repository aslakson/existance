      "content": "The law of supply and demand is not to be conned. As the supply of money\n(of claims) increases relative to the supply of tangible assets in the economy,\nprices must eventually rise. Thus the earnings saved by the productive members\nof the society lose value in terms of goods. When the economy&#x2019;s books are\nfinally balanced, one finds that this loss in value represents the goods\npurchased by the government for welfare or other purposes with the money\nproceeds of the government bonds financed by bank credit expansion.",
