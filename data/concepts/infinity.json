      "content": "There is a use of [the concept] &#x201C;infinity&#x201D; which is valid, as Aristotle\nobserved, and that is the mathematical use. It is valid only when used to\nindicate a potentiality, never an actuality. Take the number series as an\nexample. You can say it is infinite in the sense that, no matter how many\nnumbers you count, there is always another number. You can always keep on\ncounting; there&#x2019;s no end. In that sense it is infinite&#x2014;as a potential. But\nnotice that, actually, however many numbers you count, wherever you stop, you\nonly reached that point, you only got so far.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. That&#x2019;s Aristotle&#x2019;s point\nthat the actual is always finite. Infinity exists only in the form of the\nability of certain series to be extended indefinitely; but however much they\nare extended, in actual fact, wherever you stop it is finite.",

      "content": "Every unit of length, no matter how small, has some specific extension; every\nunit of time, no matter how small, has some specific duration. The idea of an\n<em>infinitely</em> small amount of length or temporal duration has validity only as a\nmathematical device useful for making certain calculations, <em>not</em> as a\ndescription of components of reality. Reality does not contain either points or\ninstants (in the mathematical sense). By analogy: the average family has 2.2\nchildren, but no actual family has 2.2 children; the &#x201C;average family&#x201D; exists\nonly as a mathematical device.",
