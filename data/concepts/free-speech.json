      "content": "Freedom of speech means freedom from interference, suppression or punitive\naction by the government&#x2014;and nothing else.  It does not mean the right to\ndemand the financial support or the material means to express your views at the\nexpense of other men who may not wish to support you.  Freedom of speech\nincludes the freedom not to agree, not to listen and not to support one&#x2019;s own\nantagonists.  A &#x201C;right&#x201D; does not include the material implementation of that\nright by other men; it includes only the freedom to earn that implementation by\none&#x2019;s own effort.  Private citizens cannot use physical force or coercion; they\ncannot <em>censor</em> or <em>suppress</em> anyone&#x2019;s views or publications.  Only the\ngovernment can do so.  And <em>censorship</em> is a concept that pertains <em>only</em> to\ngovernmental action.",

It is forgotten that the right of free speech means the\nfreedom to advocate one&#x2019;s views and to bear the possible consequences,\nincluding disagreement with others, opposition, unpopularity and lack of\nsupport.  The political function of &#x201C;the right of free speech&#x201D; is to protect\ndissenters and unpopular minorities from forcible suppression&#x2014;not to guarantee\nthem the support, advantages and rewards of a popularity they have not gained.",

I have not read any of\nthe books or seen any of the current movies belonging to that category, and I\ndo not intend ever to read or see them.  The descriptions provided in legal\ncases, as well as the &#x201C;modern&#x201D; touches in &#x201C;soft-core&#x201D; productions, are\nsufficient grounds on which to form an opinion.  The reason of my opinion is\nthe opposite of the usual one: I do <em>not</em> regard sex as evil&#x2014;I regard it as\n<em>good</em>, as one of the most important aspects of human life, too important to be\nmade the subject of public <em>anatomical</em> display.  But the issue here is not\none&#x2019;s view of sex.  The issue is freedom of speech and of the press&#x2014;i.e., the\nright to hold <em>any</em> view and to express it.",

Apart from criminal actions (such as rape),\nthis aspect includes the need to protect people from being confronted with\nsights they regard as loathsome.
