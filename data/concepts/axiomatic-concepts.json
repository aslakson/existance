The base of man&#x2019;s knowledge&#x2014;of all other concepts, all\naxioms, propositions and thought&#x2014;consists of axiomatic concepts.",

      "content": "[The] underscoring of primary facts is one of the crucial epistemological\nfunctions of axiomatic concepts. It is also the reason why they can be\ntranslated into a statement only in the form of a repetition (as a base and a\nreminder): Existence exists&#x2014;Consciousness is conscious&#x2014;A is A. (This converts\naxiomatic concepts into formal axioms.)",

      "content": "Epistemologically, the formation of axiomatic concepts is an act of\nabstraction, a selective focusing on and mental isolation of metaphysical\nfundamentals; but metaphysically, it is an act of integration&#x2014;the <em>widest\nintegration possible to man</em>: it unites and embraces the total of his\nexperience.",

      "content": "Since axiomatic concepts refer to facts of reality and are not a matter of\n&#x201C;faith&#x201D; or of man&#x2019;s arbitrary choice, there is a way to ascertain whether a\ngiven concept is axiomatic or not: one ascertains it by observing the fact that\nan axiomatic concept cannot be escaped, that it is implicit in all knowledge,\nthat it has to be accepted and used even in the process of any attempt to deny\nit.",

It is by means of axiomatic concepts that man grasps and\nholds this continuity, bringing it into his conscious awareness and\n<em>knowledge</em>. It is axiomatic concepts that identify the precondition of\nknowledge: the distinction between existence and consciousness, between reality\nand the awareness of reality, between the object and the subject of cognition.\nAxiomatic concepts are the foundation of <em>objectivity</em>.",

Axiomatic concepts are\nepistemological guidelines. They sum up the essence of all human cognition:\nsomething exists of which I am <em>conscious</em>; I must discover its <em>identity</em>.",
