(Materials exist only in the form of\nspecific entities, such as a nugget of gold, a plank of wood, a drop or an\nocean of water.) The concept of &#x201C;gold,&#x201D; for instance, is formed by isolating\ngold objects from all others, then abstracting and retaining the material, the\ngold, and omitting the measurements of the objects (or of the alloys) in which\ngold may exist. Thus, the material is the same in all the concrete instances\nsubsumed under the concept, and differs only in quantity.",
