      "content": "The virtue of Pride can best be described by the term: &#x201C;moral ambitiousness.&#x201D;\nIt means that one must earn the right to hold oneself as one&#x2019;s own highest\nvalue by achieving one&#x2019;s own moral perfection&#x2014;which one achieves by never\naccepting any code of irrational virtues impossible to practice and by never\nfailing to practice the virtues one knows to be rational&#x2014;by never accepting an\nunearned guilt and never earning any, or, if one <em>has</em> earned it, never leaving\nit uncorrected&#x2014;by never resigning oneself passively to any flaws in one&#x2019;s\ncharacter&#x2014;by never placing any concern, wish, fear or mood of the moment above\nthe reality of one&#x2019;s own self-esteem. And, above all, it means one&#x2019;s rejection\nof the role of a sacrificial animal, the rejection of any doctrine that\npreaches self-immolation as a moral virtue or duty.",
