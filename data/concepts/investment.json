This means that he is relying on a continuous process of\nproduction&#x2014;which requires an uninterrupted flow of goods saved to fuel further\nand further production. This flow is &#x201C;investment capital,&#x201D; the stock seed of\nindustry. When a rich man lends money to others, what he lends to them is the\ngoods which he has not consumed.",
