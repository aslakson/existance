You have\nheard it expressed in such bromides as: &#x201C;A hungry man is not free,&#x201D; or &#x201C;It\nmakes no difference to a worker whether he takes orders from a businessman or\nfrom a bureaucrat.&#x201D; Most people accept these equivocations&#x2014;and yet they know\nthat the poorest laborer in America is freer and more secure than the richest\ncommissar in Soviet Russia. What is the basic, the essential, the crucial\nprinciple that differentiates freedom from slavery? It is the principle of\nvoluntary action <em>versus</em> physical coercion or compulsion.",
