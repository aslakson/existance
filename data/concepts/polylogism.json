The polylogist\ndivides men into groups, and holds that each group has by nature (or creates\nfor itself by choice) its own distinctive method of inference based on its own\ndistinctive logical laws, so that the inferences that are entirely logical for\none group are entirely illogical for the others .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",
