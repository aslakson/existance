Whether its basic constituent elements are\natoms, or subatomic particles, or some yet undiscovered forms of energy, it is\nnot ruled by a consciousness or by will or by chance, but by the Law of\nIdentity. All the countless forms, motions, combinations and dissolutions of\nelements within the universe&#x2014;from a floating speck of dust to the formation of\na galaxy to the emergence of life&#x2014;are caused and determined by the identities\nof the elements involved. Nature is the <em>metaphysically given</em>&#x2014;i.e., the\nnature of nature is outside the power of any volition.",
