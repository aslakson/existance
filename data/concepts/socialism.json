      "content": "The socialists had a certain kind of logic on their side: if the collective\nsacrifice of all to all <em>is</em> the moral ideal, then they wanted to establish\nthis ideal in practice, here and on this earth.  The arguments that socialism\nwould not and could not work, did not stop them: neither has altruism ever\nworked, but this has not caused men to stop and question it.  Only <em>reason</em> can\nask such questions&#x2014;and <em>reason</em>, they were told on all sides, has nothing to\ndo with morality, morality lies outside the realm of reason, no <em>rational</em>\nmorality can ever be defined.",

Observe the difference in those\ntwo theories: socialism negates private property rights altogether, and\nadvocates &#x201C;the vesting of <em>ownership and control</em>&#x201D; in the community as a whole,\ni.e., in the state; fascism leaves <em>ownership</em> in the hands of private\nindividuals, but transfers <em>control</em> of the property to the government.",

Selfish individuals may be unhappy, the Nazis said, but\nwhat we have established in Germany is the ideal system, <em>socialism</em>.  In its\nNazi usage this term is not restricted to a theory of economics; it is to be\nunderstood in a fundamental sense.  &#x201C;Socialism&#x201D; for the Nazis denotes the\nprinciple of collectivism as such and its corollary, statism&#x2014;in every field of\nhuman action, including but not limited to economics.",
