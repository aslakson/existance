Caught in the middle between these\nforces&#x2014;between a psychopathic hippie screaming: satisfaction now!  and a\njungle chieftain intoning: tribal obedience!&#x2014;sentenced by nature to\nineradicable conflict, guilt, anxiety, and neurosis is man, i.e., man&#x2019;s mind,\nhis reason or &#x201C;ego,&#x201D; the faculty which is able to grasp reality, and which\nexists primarily to mediate between the clashing demands of the psyche&#x2019;s two\nirrational masters.",
