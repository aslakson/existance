Whatever intellectual progress men have achieved rests on his\nachievements.",

No matter what\nremnants of Platonism did exist in Aristotle&#x2019;s system, his incomparable\nachievement lay in the fact that he defined the <em>basic</em> principles of a\nrational view of existence and of man&#x2019;s consciousness: that there is only <em>one</em>\nreality, the one which man perceives&#x2014;that it exists as an <em>objective</em> absolute\n(which means: independently of the consciousness, the wishes or the feelings of\nany perceiver)&#x2014;that the task of man&#x2019;s consciousness is to <em>perceive</em>, not to\ncreate, reality&#x2014;that abstractions are man&#x2019;s method of integrating his sensory\nmaterial&#x2014;that man&#x2019;s mind is his only tool of knowledge&#x2014;that A is A.",

      "content": "Aristotle is the champion of this world, the champion of nature, as against the\nsupernaturalism of Plato. Denying Plato&#x2019;s World of Forms, Aristotle maintains\nthat there is only one reality: the world of particulars in which we live, the\nworld men perceive by means of their physical senses. Universals, he holds, are\nmerely aspects of existing entities, isolated in thought by a process of\nselective attention; they have no existence apart from particulars. Reality is\ncomprised, not of Platonic abstractions, but of concrete, individual entities,\neach with a definite nature, each obeying the laws inherent in its nature.\nAristotle&#x2019;s universe is the universe of science. The physical world, in his\nview, is not a shadowy projection controlled by a divine dimension, but an\nautonomous, self-sufficient realm. It is an orderly, intelligible, <em>natural</em>\nrealm, open to the mind of man.",
