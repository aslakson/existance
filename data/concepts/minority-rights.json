But this principle, which forbids\ndiscrimination, is applied by most of the &#x201C;liberal&#x201D; intellectuals in a\n<em>discriminatory</em> manner: it is applied only to racial or religious minorities.\nIt is not applied to that small, exploited, denounced, defenseless minority\nwhich consists of businessmen.",
