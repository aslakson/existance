They have taught\nhim that his body and his consciousness are two enemies engaged in deadly\nconflict, two antagonists of opposite natures, contradictory claims,\nincompatible needs, that to benefit one is to injure the other, that his soul\nbelongs to a supernatural realm, but his body is an evil prison holding it in\nbondage to this earth&#x2014;and that the good is to defeat his body, to undermine it\nby years of patient struggle, digging his way to that glorious jail-break which\nleads into the freedom of the grave.",

Both demand the surrender of your mind, one to their\nrevelations, the other to their reflexes. No matter how loudly they posture in\nthe roles of irreconcilable antagonists, their moral codes are alike, and so\nare their aims: in matter&#x2014;the enslavement of man&#x2019;s body, in spirit&#x2014;the\ndestruction of his mind.",

He will be an <em>integrated</em> man, that is: a thinker who is a man of\naction. He will know that ideas divorced from consequent action are fraudulent,\nand that action divorced from ideas is suicidal. He will know that the\nconceptual level of psycho-epistemology&#x2014;the volitional level of reason and\nthought&#x2014;is the basic necessity of man&#x2019;s survival and his greatest moral\nvirtue.
