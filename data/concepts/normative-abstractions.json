Cognitive abstractions are the\nfundamental chain, on which all the others depend. Such chains are mental\nintegrations, serving a special purpose and formed accordingly by a special\ncriterion. <em>Cognitive</em> abstractions are formed by the criterion of: what is\n<em>essential</em>? (epistemologically essential to distinguish one class of existents\nfrom all others). <em>Normative</em> abstractions are formed by the criterion of: what\nis <em>good</em>?",

      "content": "Consider the long conceptual chain that starts from simple, ostensive\ndefinitions and rises to higher and still higher concepts, forming a\nhierarchical structure of knowledge so complex that no electronic computer\ncould approach it. It is by means of such chains that man has to acquire and\nretain his knowledge of reality.",

      "content": "The process of a child&#x2019;s development consists of acquiring knowledge, which\nrequires the development of his capacity to grasp and deal with an\never-widening range of abstractions. This involves the growth of two\ninterrelated but different chains of abstractions, two hierarchical structures\nof concepts, which should be integrated, but seldom are: the <em>cognitive</em> and\nthe <em>normative</em>. The first deals with knowledge of the facts of reality&#x2014;the\nsecond, with the evaluation of these facts. The first forms the epistemological\nfoundation of science&#x2014;the second, of morality and of art.",
