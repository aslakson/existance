(According to Plato, they do so by evoking\nthe memory of the archetypes which we had known, before birth, in that other\ndimension.)",

Thus for Plato\nabstractions are supernatural existents.  They are nonmaterial entities in\nanother dimension, independent of man&#x2019;s mind and of any of their material\nembodiments.  The Forms, Plato tells us repeatedly, are what is really real.\nThe particulars they subsume&#x2014;the concretes that make up this world&#x2014;are not;\nthey have only a shadowy, dreamlike half-reality.",
