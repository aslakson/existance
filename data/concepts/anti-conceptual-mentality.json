It is a mentality which\ndecided, at a certain point of development, that it knows enough and does not\ncare to look further. What does it accept as &#x201C;enough&#x201D;? The immediately given,\ndirectly perceivable concretes of its background.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",

Concepts, to him, are merely some sort of code\nsignals employed by other people for some inexplicable reason, signals that\nhave no relation to reality or to himself. He treats concepts as if they were\npercepts, and their meaning changes with any change of circumstances. Whatever\nhe learns or happens to retain is treated, in his mind, as if it had always\nbeen there, as if it were an item of direct awareness, with no memory of how he\nacquired it&#x2014;as a random store of unprocessed material that comes and goes at\nthe mercy of chance .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. He does not seek knowledge&#x2014;he &#x201C;exposes himself&#x201D; to\n&#x201C;experience,&#x201D; hoping, in effect, that it will push something into his mind; if\nnothing happens, he feels with self-righteous rancor that there is nothing he\ncan do about it. Mental action, i.e., mental <em>effort</em>&#x2014;any sort of processing,\nidentifying, organizing, integrating, critical evaluation or control of his\nmental content&#x2014;is an alien realm.",

To understand and to apply them\nrequires a long conceptual chain, which he has made his mind incapable of\nholding beyond the first, rudimentary links. If his professed beliefs&#x2014;i.e.,\nthe rules and slogans of his group&#x2014;are challenged, he feels his consciousness\ndissolving in fog. Hence, his fear of outsiders. The word &#x201C;outsiders,&#x201D; to him,\nmeans the whole wide world beyond the confines of his village or town or\ngang&#x2014;the world of all those people who do not live by his &#x201C;rules.&#x201D; He does not\nknow why he feels that outsiders are a deadly threat to him and why they fill\nhim with helpless terror. The threat is not existential, but\npsycho-epistemological: to deal with them requires that he rise above his\n&#x201C;rules&#x201D; to the level of abstract principles. He would die rather than attempt\nit.",
