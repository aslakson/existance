Appeasement is not\nconsideration for the feelings of others, it is <em>consideration for and\ncompliance with the unjust, irrational and evil feelings of others</em>. It is a\npolicy of exempting the emotions of others from moral judgment, and of\nwillingness to sacrifice innocent, virtuous victims to the evil malice of such\nemotions.",

      "content": "The truly and deliberately evil men are a very small minority; it is the\nappeaser who unleashes them on mankind; it is the appeaser&#x2019;s intellectual\nabdication that invites them to take over. When a culture&#x2019;s dominant trend is\ngeared to irrationality, the thugs win over the appeasers. When intellectual\nleaders fail to foster the best in the mixed, unformed, vacillating character\nof people at large, the thugs are sure to bring out the worst. When the ablest\nmen turn into cowards, the average men turn into brutes.",
