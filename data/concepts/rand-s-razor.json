They forbid the random coining of\nspecial concepts to designate any and every group of existents with any\npossible combination of characteristics. For example, there is no concept to\ndesignate &#x201C;Beautiful blondes with blue eyes, 5&#x2019;5&#x201D; tall and 24 years old.&#x201D; Such\nentities or groupings are identified <em>descriptively</em>. If such a special concept\nexisted, it would lead to senseless duplication of cognitive effort (and to\nconceptual chaos): everything of significance discovered about that group would\napply to all other young women as well. There would be no cognitive\njustification for such a concept&#x2014;unless some <em>essential</em> characteristic were\ndiscovered, distinguishing such blondes from all other women and requiring\nspecial study, in which case a special concept would become necessary.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",
