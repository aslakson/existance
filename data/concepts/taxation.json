If an average housewife struggles\nwith her incomprehensibly shrinking budget and sees a tycoon in a resplendent\nlimousine, she might well think that just one of his diamond cuff links would\nsolve all her problems. She has no way of knowing that if all the personal\nluxuries of all the tycoons were expropriated, it would not feed her\nfamily&#x2014;and millions of other, similar families&#x2014;for one week; and that the\nentire country would starve on the first morning of the week to follow .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\nHow would she know it, if all the voices she hears are telling her that we must\nsoak the rich?",
