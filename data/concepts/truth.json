He retains concepts in his mind by means of definitions. He organizes\nconcepts into propositions&#x2014;and the truth or falsehood of his propositions\nrests, not only on their relation to the facts he asserts, but also on the\ntruth or falsehood of the definitions of the concepts he uses to assert them,\nwhich rests on the truth or falsehood of his designations of <em>essential</em>\ncharacteristics.",

They differ merely in\ntheir subject matter, but then so do the propositions of astronomy and of\nimmunology. Truths about metaphysical and about man-made facts are learned and\nvalidated by the same process: by observation; and, <em>qua truths</em>, both\nare equally necessary.

Truth is the recognition of\nreality. (This is known as the correspondence theory of truth.) The same thing\ncannot be true and untrue at the same time and in the same respect. That catch\nphrase, therefore, means: a. that the Law of Identity is invalid; b. that there\nis no objectively perceivable reality, only some indeterminate flux which is\nnothing in particular, i.e., that there is no reality (in which case, there can\nbe no such thing as truth); or c. that the two debaters perceive two different\nuniverses (in which case, no debate is possible). (The purpose of the catch\nphrase is the destruction of objectivity.)",
