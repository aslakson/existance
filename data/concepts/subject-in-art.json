      "content": "The subject is not the only attribute of art, but it is the fundamental one, it\nis the end to which all the others are the means. In most esthetic theories,\nhowever, the end&#x2014;the subject&#x2014;is omitted from consideration, and only the\nmeans are regarded as esthetically relevant. Such theories set up a false\ndichotomy and claim that a slob portrayed by the technical means of a genius is\npreferable to a goddess portrayed by the technique of an amateur. I hold that\n<em>both</em> are esthetically offensive; but while the second is merely esthetic\nincompetence, the first is an esthetic crime.",
