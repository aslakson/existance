To hold one&#x2019;s own life as one&#x2019;s ultimate value, and one&#x2019;s own happiness\nas one&#x2019;s highest purpose are two aspects of the same achievement.\nExistentially, the activity of pursuing rational goals is the activity of\nmaintaining one&#x2019;s life; psychologically, its result, reward and concomitant is\nan emotional state of happiness. It is by experiencing happiness that one lives\none&#x2019;s life, in any hour, year or the whole of it. And when one experiences the\nkind of pure happiness that is an end in itself&#x2014;the kind that makes one think:\n&#x201C;<em>This</em> is worth living for&#x201D;&#x2014;what one is greeting and affirming in emotional\nterms is the metaphysical fact that <em>life</em> is an end in itself.",
