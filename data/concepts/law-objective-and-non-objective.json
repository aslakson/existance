      "content": "The retaliatory use of force requires <em>objective</em> rules of evidence to\nestablish that a crime has been committed and to <em>prove</em> who committed it, as\nwell as <em>objective</em> rules to define punishments and enforcement procedures. Men\nwho attempt to prosecute crimes, without such rules, are a lynch mob. If a\nsociety left the retaliatory use of force in the hands of individual citizens,\nit would degenerate into mob rule, lynch law and an endless series of bloody\nprivate feuds or vendettas.",

Such a rule would be evil, but almost bearable; men could endure the\nharshest edicts, provided these edicts were known, specific and stable; it is\nnot the known that breaks men&#x2019;s spirits, but the unpredictable. A dictatorship\nhas to be capricious; it has to rule by means of the unexpected, the\nincomprehensible, the wantonly irrational; it has to deal not in death, but in\n<em>sudden</em> death; a state of chronic uncertainty is what men are psychologically\nunable to bear.",
