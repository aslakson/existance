And no one came to say that your life\nbelongs to you and that the good is to live it.",

The intrinsic theory holds that\nthe good is inherent in certain things or actions as such, regardless of their\ncontext and consequences, regardless of any benefit or injury they may cause to\nthe actors and subjects involved. It is a theory that divorces the concept of\n&#x201C;good&#x201D; from beneficiaries, and the concept of &#x201C;value&#x201D; from valuer and\npurpose&#x2014;claiming that the good is good in, by, and of itself.",
