      "content": "I consider marriage a very important institution, but it is important <em>when</em>\nand <em>if</em> two people have found the person with whom they wish to spend the rest\nof their lives&#x2014;a question of which no man or woman can be automatically\ncertain. When one is certain that one&#x2019;s choice is final, then marriage is, of\ncourse, a desirable state. But this does <em>not</em> mean that any relationship based\non less than total certainty is improper. I think the question of an affair or\na marriage depends on the knowledge and the position of the two persons\ninvolved and should be left up to them. Either is moral, provided only that\nboth parties take the relationship seriously and that it is based on values.",
