It is obvious that these terms and relationships depend on\nan identification of man&#x2019;s nature, that they would be different if they pertain\nto a society of rational beings or to a colony of ants. It is obvious that they\nwill be radically different if men deal with one another as free, independent\nindividuals, on the premise that every man is an end in himself&#x2014;or as members\nof a pack, each regarding the others as the means to <em>his</em> ends and to the ends\nof &#x201C;the pack as a whole.&#x201D;",
