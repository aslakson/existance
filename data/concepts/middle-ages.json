It was as close to a state of pure anarchy as men could come.\nThe feudal system grew out of the need for organized protection.  The system,\nin essence, consisted in the peasants swearing allegiance to a lord, who\nclaimed ownership of the land and a percentage of their harvest in exchange for\nhis duty to protect them against military attacks.",

Hating man&#x2019;s body, they said that pleasure is evil, and virtue consists\nof renunciation.  Hating this earth, they said that it is a prison where man is\ndoomed to pain, misery, calamity.
