It is the\nnotion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man&#x2019;s genetic\nlineage&#x2014;the notion that a man&#x2019;s intellectual and characterological traits are\nproduced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means, in\npractice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, but\nby the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors.",

      "content": "Like every other form of collectivism, racism is a quest for the unearned. It\nis a quest for automatic knowledge&#x2014;for an automatic evaluation of men&#x2019;s\ncharacters that bypasses the responsibility of exercising rational or moral\njudgment&#x2014;and, above all, a quest for <em>an automatic self-esteem</em> (or\npseudo-self-esteem).",

      "content": "Today, racism is regarded as a crime if practiced by a majority&#x2014;but as an\ninalienable right if practiced by a minority. The notion that one&#x2019;s culture is\nsuperior to all others solely because it represents the traditions of one&#x2019;s\nancestors, is regarded as chauvinism if claimed by a majority&#x2014;but as &#x201C;ethnic&#x201D;\npride if claimed by a minority. Resistance to change and progress is regarded\nas reactionary if demonstrated by a majority&#x2014;but retrogression to a Balkan\nvillage, to an Indian tepee or to the jungle is hailed if demonstrated by a\nminority.",
