Thus, altruism gauges a man&#x2019;s virtue by the degree to which he\nsurrenders, renounces or betrays his values (since help to a stranger or an\nenemy is regarded as more virtuous, less &#x201C;selfish,&#x201D; than help to those one\nloves). The rational principle of conduct is the exact opposite: always act in\naccordance with the hierarchy of your values, and never sacrifice a greater\nvalue to a lesser one.",
