Three in particular are\nprevalent today: logical truth vs. factual truth; the logically possible vs.\nthe empirically possible; and the a priori vs. the a posteriori.",

Man&#x2019;s knowledge is not acquired by logic apart from experience or\nby experience apart from logic, but <em>by the application of logic to\nexperience</em>.  All truths are the product of a logical identification of the\nfacts of experience.",
