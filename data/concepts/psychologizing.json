With reckless irresponsibility, which an old-fashioned\nmystic oracle would hesitate to match, he ascribes to his victims any\nmotivation that suits his purpose, ignoring their denials. Since he is dealing\nwith the great &#x201C;unknowable&#x201D;&#x2014;which used to be life after death or extrasensory\nperception, but is now man&#x2019;s subconscious&#x2014;all rules of evidence, logic and\nproof are suspended, and anything goes (which is what attracts him to his\nracket).",
