      "content": "Thinking is man&#x2019;s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And his\nbasic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of you\npractice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willful\nsuspension of one&#x2019;s consciousness, the refusal to think&#x2014;not blindness, but the\nrefusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act of\nunfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of\njudgment&#x2014;on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you\nrefuse to identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the\nverdict &#x201C;It <em>is</em>.&#x201D; Non-thinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate\nexistence, an attempt to wipe out reality. But existence exists; reality is not\nto be wiped out, it will merely wipe out the wiper. By refusing to say &#x201C;It is,&#x201D;\nyou are refusing to say &#x201C;I am.&#x201D; By suspending your judgment, you are negating\nyour person. When a man declares: &#x201C;Who am I to know?&#x201D; he is declaring: &#x201C;Who am\nI to live?&#x201D;",

      "content": "It is not any crime you have ever committed that infects your soul with\npermanent guilt, it is none of your failures, errors or flaws, but the\n<em>blank-out</em> by which you attempt to evade them&#x2014;it is not any sort of Original\nSin or unknown prenatal deficiency, but the knowledge and fact of your basic\ndefault, of suspending your mind, of refusing to think. Fear and guilt are your\nchronic emotions, they are real and you do deserve them, but they don&#x2019;t come\nfrom the superficial reasons you invent to disguise their cause, not from your\n&#x201C;selfishness,&#x201D; weakness or ignorance, but from a real and basic threat to your\nexistence: <em>fear</em>, because you have abandoned your weapon of survival, <em>guilt</em>,\nbecause you know you have done it volitionally.",
