Communication is merely the consequence,\n<em>not</em> the cause nor the primary purpose of concept-formation&#x2014;a crucial\nconsequence, of invaluable importance to men, but still only a consequence.\n<em>Cognition precedes communication</em>; the necessary precondition of communication\nis that one have something to communicate.  (This is true even of communication\namong animals, or of communication by grunts and growls among inarticulate men,\nlet alone of communication by means of so complex and exacting a tool as\nlanguage.)",
