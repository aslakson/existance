A country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral\nprerogatives, any claim to national rights or sovereignty, and becomes an\noutlaw.",

A dictatorship\nhas to be capricious; it has to rule by means of the unexpected, the\nincomprehensible, the wantonly irrational; it has to deal not in death, but in\n<em>sudden</em> death; a state of chronic uncertainty is what men are psychologically\nunable to bear.",
