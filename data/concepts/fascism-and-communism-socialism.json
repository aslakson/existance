Can&#x2019;t you see past the guff and recognize the essence?\nOne country is dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, that the\ncollective is all.  The individual held as evil, the mass&#x2014;as God.  No motive\nand no virtue permitted&#x2014;except that of service to the proletariat.  That&#x2019;s one\nversion [communism].  Here&#x2019;s another.  A country dedicated to the proposition\nthat man has no rights, that the State is all.  The individual held as evil,\nthe race&#x2014;as God.  No motive and no virtue permitted&#x2014;except that of service to\nthe race [fascism].  Am I raving or is this the cold reality of two continents\nalready?  Watch the pincer movement.  If you&#x2019;re sick of one version, we push\nyou into the other.  We get you coming and going.  We&#x2019;ve closed the doors.\nWe&#x2019;ve fixed the coin.  Heads&#x2014;collectivism, and tails&#x2014;collectivism.  Fight the\ndoctrine which slaughters the individual with a doctrine which slaughters the\nindividual.  Give up your soul to a council&#x2014;or give it up to a leader.  But\ngive it up, give it up, give it up.  My technique .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Offer poison as food\nand poison as antidote.",

There will be no license, no free space, in which the individual\nbelongs to himself.  This is Socialism&#x2014;not such trifles as the private\npossession of the means of production.  Of what importance is that if I range\nmen firmly within a discipline they cannot escape?  Let them then own land or\nfactories as much as they please.  The decisive factor is that the State,\nthrough the party, is supreme over them, regardless whether they are owners or\nworkers.  All that, you see, is unessential. Our Socialism goes far deeper\n.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",
