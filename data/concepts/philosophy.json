As against the special sciences, which deal only\nwith particular aspects, philosophy deals with those aspects of the universe\nwhich pertain to everything that exists. In the realm of cognition, the special\nsciences are the trees, but philosophy is the soil which makes the forest\npossible.",

This view serves as a base, a frame of reference, for all his actions,\nmental or physical, psychological or existential. This view tells him the\nnature of the universe with which he has to deal (metaphysics); the means by\nwhich he is to deal with it, i.e., the means of acquiring knowledge\n(epistemology); the standards by which he is to choose his goals and values, in\nregard to his own life and character (ethics)&#x2014;and in regard to society\n(politics); the means of concretizing this view is given to him by esthetics.",
