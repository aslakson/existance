It is an enormous and glorious power&#x2014;and it is\nthe only meaning of the concept &#x201C;creative.&#x201D; &#x201C;Creation&#x201D; does not (and\nmetaphysically cannot) mean the power to bring something into existence out of\nnothing. &#x201C;Creation&#x201D; means the power to bring into existence an arrangement (or\ncombination or integration) of natural elements that had not existed before.\n(This is true of any human product, scientific or esthetic: man&#x2019;s imagination\nis nothing more than the ability to rearrange the things he has observed in\nreality.) The best and briefest identification of man&#x2019;s power in regard to\nnature is Francis Bacon&#x2019;s &#x201C;Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.&#x201D; In this\ncontext, &#x201C;to be commanded&#x201D; means to be made to serve man&#x2019;s purposes; &#x201C;to be\nobeyed&#x201D; means that they cannot be served unless man discovers the properties of\nnatural elements and uses them accordingly.",
