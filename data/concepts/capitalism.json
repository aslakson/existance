The answer lies in the fact that the lifeline feeding any\nsocial system is a culture&#x2019;s dominant philosophy and that capitalism never had\na philosophical base. It was the last and (theoretically) incomplete product of\nan Aristotelian influence. As a resurgent tide of mysticism engulfed philosophy\nin the nineteenth century, capitalism was left in an intellectual vacuum, its\nlifeline cut. Neither its moral nature nor even its political principles had\never been fully understood or defined. Its alleged defenders regarded it as\ncompatible with government controls (i.e., government interference into the\neconomy), ignoring the meaning and implications of the concept of\nlaissez-faire. Thus, what existed in practice, in the nineteenth century, was\nnot pure capitalism, but variously mixed economies. Since controls necessitate\nand breed further controls, it was the statist element of the mixtures that\nwrecked them; it was the free, capitalist element that took the blame.",
