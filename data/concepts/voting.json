      "content": "A majority vote is not an epistemological validation of an idea. Voting is\nmerely a proper political device&#x2014;within a strictly, constitutionally delimited\nsphere of action&#x2014;for choosing the practical <em>means</em> of implementing a\nsociety&#x2019;s basic principles. But those principles are not determined by vote.",

When\na country&#x2019;s constitution places individual rights outside the reach of public\nauthorities, the sphere of political power is severely delimited&#x2014;and thus the\ncitizens may, safely and properly, agree to abide by the decisions of a\nmajority vote in this delimited sphere. The lives and property of minorities or\ndissenters are not at stake, are not subject to vote and are not endangered by\nany majority decision; no man or group holds a blank check on power over\nothers.",
