The only\naction which a government can take to protect free competition is:\n<em>Laissez-faire</em>!&#x2014;which, in free translation, means: <em>Hands off</em>!  But the\nantitrust laws established exactly opposite conditions&#x2014;and achieved the exact\nopposite of the results they had been intended to achieve.",

He acts in the\nknowledge that some of them will not be able to afford the cut, while he is,\nand that he will eventually pick up their business.  He is able to afford the\ncut when and if his productive efficiency is greater than theirs, which lowers\nhis costs to a level they cannot match .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.
