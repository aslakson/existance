But\nthe possibility of human immorality is not the only objection to anarchy: even\na society whose every member were fully rational and faultlessly moral, could\nnot function in a state of anarchy; it is the need of <em>objective</em> laws and of\nan arbiter for honest disagreements among men that necessitates the\nestablishment of a government.",

Instead of a single, monopolistic government, they\ndeclare, there should be a number of different governments in the same\ngeographical area, competing for the allegiance of individual citizens, with\nevery citizen free to &#x201C;shop&#x201D; and to patronize whatever government he chooses.",
