His metaphysics\nconsists of a somewhat &#x201C;Byronic&#x201D; and mystically &#x201C;malevolent&#x201D; universe; his\nepistemology subordinates reason to &#x201C;will,&#x201D; or feeling or instinct or blood or\ninnate virtues of character. But, as a poet, he projects at times (not\nconsistently) a magnificent feeling for man&#x2019;s greatness, expressed in\nemotional, <em>not</em> intellectual, terms.",

      "content": "Nietzsche&#x2019;s rebellion against altruism consisted of replacing the sacrifice of\noneself to others by the sacrifice of others to oneself. He proclaimed that the\nideal man is moved, not by reason, but by his &#x201C;blood,&#x201D; by his innate instincts,\nfeelings and will to power&#x2014;that he is predestined by birth to rule others and\nsacrifice them to himself, while <em>they</em> are predestined by birth to be his\nvictims and slaves&#x2014;that reason, logic, principles are futile and debilitating,\nthat morality is useless, that the &#x201C;superman&#x201D; is &#x201C;beyond good and evil,&#x201D; that\nhe is a &#x201C;beast of prey&#x201D; whose ultimate standard is nothing but his own whim.\nThus Nietzsche&#x2019;s rejection of the Witch Doctor consisted of elevating Attila\ninto a moral ideal&#x2014;which meant: a double surrender of morality to the Witch\nDoctor.",
