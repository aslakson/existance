      "content": "[Peter Keating is] paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling\nhimself that he&#x2019;s been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there\never been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness&#x2014;in other people&#x2019;s eyes.\nFame, admiration, envy&#x2014;all that which comes from others. Others dictated his\nconvictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed\nhe held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn&#x2019;t\nwant to be great, but to be thought great. He didn&#x2019;t want to build, but to be\nadmired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on\nothers. There&#x2019;s your actual selflessness. It&#x2019;s his ego that he&#x2019;s betrayed and\ngiven up. But everybody calls him selfish .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",

      "content": "When you are in love, it means that the person you love is of great personal,\nselfish importance to you and to your life. If you were selfless, it would have\nto mean that you derive no personal pleasure or happiness from the company and\nthe existence of the person you love, and that you are motivated only by\nself-sacrificial pity for that person&#x2019;s need of you. I don&#x2019;t have to point out\nto you that no one would be flattered by, nor would accept, a concept of that\nkind. Love is not self-sacrifice, but the most profound assertion of your own\nneeds and values. It is for your <em>own</em> happiness that you need the person you\nlove, and that is the greatest compliment, the greatest tribute you can pay to\nthat person.",
