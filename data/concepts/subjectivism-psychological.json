A psychological\nsubjectivist is unable fully to identify his values or to prove their objective\nvalidity, but he may be profoundly consistent and loyal to them in practice\n(though with terrible psycho-epistemological difficulty). The amoralist does\nnot hold subjective values; he does not hold <em>any</em> values.",
