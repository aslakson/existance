They did demand that the government oversee and run the\nnation&#x2019;s economy.  The issue of legal ownership, they explained, is secondary;\nwhat counts is the issue of <em>control</em>.  Private citizens, therefore, may\ncontinue to hold titles to property&#x2014;so long as the state reserves to itself\nthe unqualified right to regulate the use of their property.",

Modern German culture, including its\nNazi climax, is the result of a complex development in the history of\nphilosophy, involving dozens of figures stretching back to the beginnings of\nWestern thought.  The same figures helped to shape every Western nation; but in\nother countries, to varying extents, the results were mixed, because there was\nalso an opposite influence or antidote at work.  In Germany, by the turn of our\ncentury, the cultural atmosphere was unmixed; the traces of the antidote had\nlong since disappeared, and the intellectual establishment was monolithic.",
