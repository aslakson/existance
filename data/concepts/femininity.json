It means an intense kind of admiration; and admiration is\nan emotion that can be experienced only by a person of strong character and\nindependent value-judgments. A &#x201C;clinging vine&#x201D; type of woman is not an admirer,\nbut an exploiter of men. Hero-worship is a demanding virtue: a woman has to be\nworthy of it and of the hero she worships. Intellectually and morally, i.e., as\na human being, she has to be his equal; then the object of her worship is\nspecifically his <em>masculinity</em>, not any human virtue she might lack.",
