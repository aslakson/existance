Yet if one examines them closely, one sees\nthat no real-life apple ever looked like that. What is it, then, that the\nartist has done? He has created a <em>visual abstraction</em>.",

      "content": "The closer an artist comes to a conceptual method of functioning visually, the\ngreater his work. The greatest of all artists, Vermeer, devoted his paintings\nto a single theme: light itself. The guiding principle of his compositions is:\nthe <em>contextual</em> nature of our perception of light (and of color). The physical\nobjects in a Vermeer canvas are chosen and placed in such a way that their\ncombined interrelationships feature, lead to and make possible the painting&#x2019;s\nbrightest patches of light, sometimes blindingly bright, in a manner which no\none has been able to render before or since.",
