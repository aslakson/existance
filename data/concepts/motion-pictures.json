Screen and\ntelevision plays are subcategories of the drama, and in the dramatic arts\n&#x201C;<em>the play is the thing</em>.&#x201D; The play is that which makes it art; the play\nprovides the end, to which all the rest is the means.",

It\nproduced a few rare, almost accidental sparks of true greatness, displaying its\nuntouched potential, then was swallowed again in a growing tide of mediocrity.",
