      "content": "The Antitrust laws&#x2014;an unenforceable, uncompliable, unjudicable mess of\ncontradictions&#x2014;have for decades kept American businessmen under a silent,\ngrowing reign of terror. Yet these laws were created and, to this day, are\nupheld by the &#x201C;conservatives,&#x201D; as a grim monument to their lack of political\nphilosophy, of economic knowledge and of any concern with principles. Under the\nAntitrust laws, a man becomes a criminal from the moment he goes into business,\nno matter what he does. For instance, if he charges prices which some\nbureaucrats judge as too high, he can be prosecuted for monopoly or for a\nsuccessful &#x201C;intent to monopolize&#x201D;; if he charges prices lower than those of his\ncompetitors, he can be prosecuted for &#x201C;unfair competition&#x201D; or &#x201C;restraint of\ntrade&#x201D;; and if he charges the same prices as his competitors, he can be\nprosecuted for &#x201C;collusion&#x201D; or &#x201C;conspiracy.&#x201D; There is only one difference in the\nlegal treatment accorded to a criminal or to a businessman: the criminal&#x2019;s\nrights are protected much more securely and objectively than the businessman&#x2019;s.",

      "content": "The alleged purpose of the Antitrust laws was to protect competition; that\npurpose was based on the socialistic fallacy that a free, unregulated market\nwill inevitably lead to the establishment of coercive monopolies. But, in fact,\nno coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be established by means of free\ntrade on a free market. Every coercive monopoly was created by government\nintervention into the economy: by special privileges, such as franchises or\nsubsidies, which closed the entry of competitors into a given field, by\nlegislative action. (For a full demonstration of this fact, I refer you to the\nworks of the best economists.) The Antitrust laws were the classic example of a\nmoral inversion prevalent in the history of capitalism: an example of the\nvictims, the businessmen, taking the blame for the evils caused by the\ngovernment, and the government using its own guilt as a justification for\nacquiring wider powers, on the pretext of &#x201C;correcting&#x201D; the evils.",
