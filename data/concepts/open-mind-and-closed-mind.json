A &#x201C;closed mind&#x201D; is usually taken to mean the\nattitude of a man impervious to ideas, arguments, facts and logic, who clings\nstubbornly to some mixture of unwarranted assumptions, fashionable catch\nphrases, tribal prejudices&#x2014;and emotions. But this is not a &#x201C;closed&#x201D; mind, it\nis a <em>passive</em> one. It is a mind that has dispensed with (or never acquired)\nthe practice of thinking or judging, and feels threatened by any request to\nconsider anything.",
