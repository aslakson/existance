A desire is not an\ninstinct. A desire to live does not give you the knowledge required for living.\nAnd even man&#x2019;s desire to live is not automatic .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Your fear of death is not\na love for life and will not give you the knowledge needed to keep it. Man must\nobtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process of thinking, which\nnature will not force him to perform. Man has the power to act as his own\ndestroyer&#x2014;and that is the way he has acted through most of his history.",
