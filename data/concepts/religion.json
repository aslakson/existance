      "content": "Christ, in terms of the Christian philosophy, is the human ideal. He\npersonifies that which men should strive to emulate. Yet, according to the\nChristian mythology, he died on the cross not for his own sins but for the sins\nof the nonideal people. In other words, a man of perfect virtue was sacrificed\nfor men who are vicious and who are expected or supposed to accept that\nsacrifice. If I were a Christian, nothing could make me more indignant than\nthat: the notion of sacrificing the ideal to the nonideal, or virtue to vice.\nAnd it is in the name of that symbol that men are asked to sacrifice themselves\nfor their inferiors. That is precisely how the symbolism is used.",

Their myth declares that he ate the fruit of the tree of\nknowledge&#x2014;he acquired a mind and became a rational being. It was the knowledge\nof good and evil&#x2014;he became a moral being. He was sentenced to earn his bread\nby his labor&#x2014;he became a productive being. He was sentenced to experience\ndesire&#x2014;he acquired the capacity of sexual enjoyment. The evils for which they\ndamn him are reason, morality, creativeness, joy&#x2014;all the cardinal values of\nhis existence. It is not his vices that their myth of man&#x2019;s fall is designed to\nexplain and condemn, it is not his errors that they hold as his guilt, but the\nessence of his nature as man. Whatever he was&#x2014;that robot in the Garden of\nEden, who existed without mind, without values, without labor, without love&#x2014;he was not man.",
