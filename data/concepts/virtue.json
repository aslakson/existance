To live,\nman must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life:\nReason&#x2014;Purpose&#x2014;Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge&#x2014;Purpose,\nas his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to\nachieve&#x2014;Self-esteem, as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to\nthink and his person is worthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living.\nThese three values imply and require all of man&#x2019;s virtues, and all his virtues\npertain to the relation of existence and consciousness: rationality,\nindependence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, pride.",
