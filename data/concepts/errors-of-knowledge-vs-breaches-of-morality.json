      "content": "Learn to distinguish the difference between errors of knowledge and breaches of\nmorality. An error of knowledge is not a moral flaw, provided you are willing\nto correct it; only a mystic would judge human beings by the standard of an\nimpossible, automatic omniscience. But a breach of morality is the conscious\nchoice of an action you know to be evil, or a willful evasion of knowledge, a\nsuspension of sight and of thought. That which you do not know, is not a moral\ncharge against you; but that which you refuse to know, is an account of infamy\ngrowing in your soul. Make every allowance for errors of knowledge; do not\nforgive or accept any breach of morality. Give the benefit of the doubt to\nthose who seek to know; but treat as potential killers those specimens of\ninsolent depravity who make demands upon you, announcing that they have and\nseek no reasons, proclaiming, as a license, that they &#x201C;just feel it&#x201D;&#x2014;or those\nwho reject an irrefutable argument by saying: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s only logic,&#x201D; which means:\n&#x201C;It&#x2019;s only reality.&#x201D; The only realm opposed to reality is the realm and premise\nof death.",
