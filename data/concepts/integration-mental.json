      "content": "<em>Integration</em> is a cardinal function of man&#x2019;s consciousness on all the levels\nof his cognitive development. First, his brain brings order into his sensory\nchaos by integrating sense data into percepts; this integration is performed\nautomatically; it requires effort, but no conscious volition. His next step is\nthe integration of percepts into concepts, as he learns to speak. Thereafter,\nhis cognitive development consists in integrating concepts into wider and ever\nwider concepts, expanding the range of his mind. This stage is fully volitional\nand demands an unremitting effort.",
