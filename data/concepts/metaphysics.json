Or are you in an incomprehensible\nchaos, a realm of inexplicable miracles, an unpredictable, unknowable flux,\nwhich your mind is impotent to grasp? Are the things you see around you\nreal&#x2014;or are they only an illusion? Do they exist independent of any\nobserver&#x2014;or are they created by the observer? Are they the object or the\nsubject of man&#x2019;s consciousness? Are they <em>what they are</em>&#x2014;or can\nthey be changed by a mere act of your consciousness, such as a wish?",

      "content": "The branch of philosophy that studies existence is metaphysics. Metaphysics\nidentifies the nature of the universe as a whole. It tells men what kind of\nworld they live in, and whether there is a supernatural dimension beyond it. It\ntells men whether they live in a world of solid entities, natural laws,\nabsolute facts, or in a world of illusory fragments, unpredictable miracles,\nand ceaseless flux. It tells men whether the things they perceive by their\nsenses and mind form a comprehensible reality, with which they can deal, or\nsome kind of unreal appearance, which leaves them staring and helpless.",
