      "content": "My views on charity are very simple. I do not consider it a major virtue and,\nabove all, I do not consider it a moral duty. There is nothing wrong in helping\nother people, if and when they are worthy of the help and you can afford to\nhelp them. I regard charity as a marginal issue. What I am fighting is the idea\nthat charity is a moral duty and a primary virtue.",

      "content": "The fact that a man has no claim on others (i.e., that it is not their moral\nduty to help him and that he cannot demand their help as his right) does not\npreclude or prohibit good will among men and does not make it immoral to offer\nor to accept voluntary, non-sacrificial assistance.",
