Like the word &#x201C;selfishness,&#x201D; and for the\nsame reasons, the word &#x201C;ambition&#x201D; has been perverted to mean only the pursuit\nof dubious or evil goals, such as the pursuit of power; this left no concept to\ndesignate the pursuit of actual values. But &#x201C;ambition&#x201D; as such is a neutral\nconcept: the evaluation of a given ambition as moral or immoral depends on the\nnature of the goal. A great scientist or a great artist is the most\npassionately ambitious of men. A demagogue seeking political power is\nambitious. So is a social climber seeking &#x201C;prestige.&#x201D; So is a modest laborer\nwho works conscientiously to acquire a home of his own. The common denominator\nis the drive to improve the conditions of one&#x2019;s existence, however broadly or\nnarrowly conceived. (&#x201C;Improvement&#x201D; is a moral term and depends on one&#x2019;s\nstandard of values. An ambition guided by an irrational standard does not, <em>in\nfact</em>, lead to improvement, but to self-destruction.)",
