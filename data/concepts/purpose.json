He does not know what his values are. He\ndoes not know how to judge. He cannot tell what is or is not important to him,\nand, therefore, he drifts helplessly at the mercy of any chance stimulus or any\nwhim of the moment. He can enjoy nothing. He spends his life searching for some\nvalue which he will never find .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",
