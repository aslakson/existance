      "content": "There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or\nnon-existence&#x2014;and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living\norganisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of\nlife is not: it depends on a specific course of action. Matter is\nindestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only\na living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or\ndeath. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action. If an\norganism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical elements remain, but its\nlife goes out of existence. It is only the concept of &#x201C;Life&#x201D; that makes the\nconcept of &#x201C;Value&#x201D; possible. It is only to a living entity that things can be\ngood or evil.",

On the <em>physical</em> level, the functions of all living organisms,\nfrom the simplest to the most complex&#x2014;from the nutritive function in the\nsingle cell of an amoeba to the blood circulation in the body of a\nman&#x2014;are actions generated by the organism itself and directed to a single\ngoal: the maintenance of the organism&#x2019;s <em>life</em>.",

      "content": "When applied to physical phenomena, such as the automatic functions of an\norganism, the term &#x201C;goal-directed&#x201D; is not to be taken to mean &#x201C;purposive&#x201D; (a\nconcept applicable only to the actions of a consciousness) and is not to imply\nthe existence of any teleological principle operating in insentient nature. I\nuse the term &#x201C;goal-directed,&#x201D; in this context, to designate the fact that the\nautomatic functions of living organisms are actions whose nature is such that\nthey result in the preservation of an organism&#x2019;s life.",

The goal of\nthat action, the ultimate <em>value</em> which, to be kept, must be gained\nthrough its every moment, is the organism&#x2019;s <em>life</em>.",
