The greatest, unprecedented, undreamed of events and\nachievements were taking place before men&#x2019;s eyes&#x2014;but men did not see them and\ndid not understand their meaning, as they do not understand it to this day. I\nam speaking of the industrial revolution, of the United States and of\ncapitalism. For the first time in history, men gained control over physical\nnature and threw off the control of men over men&#x2014;that is: men discovered\nscience and political freedom. The creative energy, the abundance, the wealth,\nthe rising standard of living for <em>every</em> level of the population were such\nthat the nineteenth century looks like a fiction-Utopia, like a blinding burst\nof sunlight, in the drab progression of most of human history. If life on earth\nis one&#x2019;s standard of value, then the nineteenth century moved mankind forward\nmore than all the other centuries combined.",
