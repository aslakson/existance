It is a set of abstract principles purporting\nto be either a correct description of reality or a set of guidelines for man&#x2019;s\nactions. Correspondence to reality is the standard of value by which one\nestimates a theory. If a theory is inapplicable to reality, by what standard\ncan it be estimated as &#x201C;good&#x201D;? If one were to accept that notion, it would\nmean: a. that the activity of man&#x2019;s mind is unrelated to reality; b. that the\npurpose of thinking is neither to acquire knowledge nor to guide man&#x2019;s actions.\n(The purpose of that catch phrase is to invalidate man&#x2019;s conceptual faculty.)",
