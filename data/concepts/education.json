The training he\nneeds is theoretical, i.e., <em>conceptual</em>. He has to be taught to think, to\nunderstand, to integrate, to prove. He has to be taught the essentials of the\nknowledge discovered in the past&#x2014;and he has to be equipped to acquire further\nknowledge by his own effort.",

      "content": "The academia-jet set coalition is attempting to tame the American character by\nthe deliberate breeding of helplessness and resignation&#x2014;in those incubators of\nlethargy known as &#x201C;Progressive&#x201D; schools, which are dedicated to the task of\ncrippling a child&#x2019;s mind by arresting his cognitive development. (See &#x201C;The\nComprachicos&#x201D; in my book <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/return-of-the-primitive.html\"><cite>The New Left: The Anti-Industrial\nRevolution</cite></a>.) It appears,\nhowever, that the &#x201C;progressive&#x201D; rich will be the first victims of their own\nsocial theories: it is the children of the well-to-do who emerge from expensive\nnursery schools and colleges as hippies, and destroy the remnants of their\nparalyzed brains by means of drugs.",
