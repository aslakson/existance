Their basic characteristic\nis <em>conflict</em>, which means: a clash of goals, which means: purposeful action in\npursuit of <em>values</em>. Thrillers are the product, the popular offshoot, of the\n<em>Romantic</em> school of art that sees man, not as a helpless pawn of fate, but as\na being who possesses volition, whose life is directed by his own\nvalue-choices. Romanticism is a value-oriented, morality-centered movement: its\nmaterial is not journalistic minutiae, but the abstract, the essential, the\nuniversal principles of man&#x2019;s nature&#x2014;and its basic literary commandment is to\nportray man &#x201C;as he might be and ought to be.&#x201D;",
