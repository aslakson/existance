By &#x201C;context&#x201D; we mean the sum of cognitive\nelements conditioning the acquisition, validity or application of any item of\nhuman knowledge. Knowledge is an organization or integration of interconnected\nelements, each relevant to the others .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.

From a child&#x2019;s grasp of the\nsimplest concept integrating a group of perceptually given concretes, to a\nscientist&#x2019;s grasp of the most complex abstractions integrating long conceptual\nchains&#x2014;all conceptualization is a contextual process; the context is the\nentire field of a mind&#x2019;s awareness or knowledge at any level of its cognitive\ndevelopment.",
