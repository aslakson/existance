      "content": "Just as a man&#x2019;s actions are preceded and determined by some form of idea in his\nmind, so a society&#x2019;s existential conditions are preceded and determined by the\nascendancy of a certain philosophy among those whose job is to deal with ideas.\nThe events of any given period of history are the result of the thinking of the\npreceding period. The nineteenth century&#x2014;with its political freedom, science,\nindustry, business, trade, all the necessary conditions of material\nprogress&#x2014;was the result and the last achievement of the intellectual power\nreleased by the Renaissance. The men engaged in those activities were still\nriding on the remnants of an Aristotelian influence in philosophy, particularly\non an Aristotelian epistemology (more implicitly than explicitly).",
