      "content": "The alleged purpose of the Antitrust laws was to protect competition; that\npurpose was based on the socialistic fallacy that a free, unregulated market\nwill inevitably lead to the establishment of coercive monopolies. But, in fact,\nno coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be established by means of free\ntrade on a free market. Every coercive monopoly was created by government\nintervention into the economy: by special privileges, such as franchises or\nsubsidies, which closed the entry of competitors into a given field, by\nlegislative action. (For a full demonstration of this fact, I refer you to the\nworks of the best economists.)",
