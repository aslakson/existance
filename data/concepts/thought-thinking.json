      "content": "All thinking is a process of identification and integration.  Man perceives a\nblob of color; by integrating the evidence of his sight and his touch, he\nlearns to identify it as a solid object; he learns to identify the object as a\ntable; he learns that the table is made of wood; he learns that the wood\nconsists of cells, that the cells consist of molecules, that the molecules\nconsist of atoms.  All through this process, the work of his mind consists of\nanswers to a single question: <em>What</em> is it?  His means to establish the truth\nof his answers is logic, and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists.\nLogic is the art of <em>non-contradictory identification</em>.  A contradiction cannot\nexist.  An atom is itself, and so is the universe; neither can contradict its\nown identity; nor can a part contradict the whole.  No concept man forms is\nvalid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of his\nknowledge.  To arrive at a contradiction is to confess an error in one&#x2019;s\nthinking; to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate one&#x2019;s mind and to evict\noneself from the realm of reality.",

And\nhis basic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of\nyou practice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willful\nsuspension of one&#x2019;s consciousness, the refusal to think&#x2014;not blindness, but the\nrefusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know.  It is the act of\nunfocusing your mind&#x2019; and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of\njudgment&#x2014;on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you\nrefuse to identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the\nverdict &#x201C;It <em>is</em>.&#x201D; Non-thinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate\nexistence, an attempt to wipe out reality.  But existence exists; reality is\nnot to be wiped out, it will merely wipe out the wiper.  By refusing to say &#x201C;It\nis,&#x201D; you are refusing to say &#x201C;I am.&#x201D; By suspending your judgment, you are\nnegating your person.
