Since a culture is a complex\nbattleground of different ideas and influences, to speak of a &#x201C;culture&#x201D; is to\nspeak only of the <em>dominant</em> ideas, always allowing for the existence of\ndissenters and exceptions.",

Tradition has nothing to do with it;\ntradition is being challenged and blasted daily in a free, civilized society:\nits citizens accept ideas and products because they are true and/or good&#x2014;not\nbecause they are old <em>nor</em> because their ancestors accepted them. In such a\nsociety, concretes change, but what remains immutable&#x2014;by individual\nconviction, not by tradition&#x2014;are those philosophical principles which\ncorrespond to reality, i.e., which are true.",
