      "content": "By itself, as a distinctive theory, the pragmatist ethics is contentless. It\nurges men to pursue &#x201C;practicality,&#x201D; but refrains from specifying any &#x201C;rigid&#x201D;\nset of values that could serve to define the concept. As a result,\npragmatists&#x2014;despite their repudiation of all systems of morality&#x2014;are\ncompelled, if they are to implement their ethical approach at all, to rely on\nvalue codes formulated by other, non-pragmatist moralists. As a rule the\npragmatist appropriates these codes without acknowledging them; he accepts them\nby a process of osmosis, eclectically absorbing the cultural deposits left by\nthe moral theories of his predecessors&#x2014;and protesting all the while the\nfutility of these theories.",
