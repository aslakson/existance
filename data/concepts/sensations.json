A\nsensation is produced by the automatic reaction of a sense organ to a stimulus\nfrom the outside world; it lasts for the duration of the immediate moment, as\nlong as the stimulus lasts and no longer. Sensations are an automatic response,\nan automatic form of knowledge, which a consciousness can neither seek nor\nevade. An organism that possesses only the faculty of sensation is guided by\nthe pleasure-pain mechanism of its body .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",

The\nexistential causes of sensations can be described and defined in conceptual\nterms (e.g., the wavelengths of light and the structure of the human eye, which\nproduce the sensations of color), but one cannot communicate what color is\nlike, to a person who is born blind. To define the meaning of the concept\n&#x201C;blue,&#x201D; for instance, one must point to some blue objects to signify, in\neffect: &#x201C;I mean <em>this</em>.&#x201D; Such an identification of a concept is known as an\n&#x201C;ostensive definition.&#x201D;",
