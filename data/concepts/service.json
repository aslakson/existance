In the language of\neconomics, the word &#x201C;service&#x201D; means <em>work</em> offered for trade on a free market,\nto be paid for by those who choose to buy it. In a free society, men deal with\none another by voluntary, uncoerced exchange, by mutual consent to mutual\nprofit, each man pursuing his own rational self-interest, none sacrificing\nhimself or others; and all values&#x2014;whether goods or services&#x2014;are <em>traded</em>, not\ngiven away.",
