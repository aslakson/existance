      "content": "A certain type of confusion about the relationship between scientific\ndiscoveries and art, leads to a frequently asked question: Is photography an\nart? The answer is: No. It is a technical, not a creative, skill. Art requires\na selective re-creation. A camera cannot perform the basic task of painting: a\nvisual conceptualization, i.e., the creation of a concrete in terms of abstract\nessentials. The selection of camera angles, lighting or lenses is merely a\nselection of the means to reproduce various aspects of the given, i.e., of an\nexisting concrete. There is an artistic element in some photographs, which is\nthe result of such selectivity as the photographer can exercise, and some of\nthem can be very beautiful&#x2014;but the same artistic element (purposeful\nselectivity) is present in many utilitarian products: in the better kinds of\nfurniture, dress design, automobiles, packaging, etc. The commercial art work\nin ads (or posters or postage stamps) is frequently done by real artists and\nhas greater esthetic value than many paintings, but utilitarian objects cannot\nbe classified as works of art.",
