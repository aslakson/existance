The market value of a product is not an intrinsic value, not a\n&#x201C;value in itself&#x201D; hanging in a vacuum. A free market never loses sight of the\nquestion: Of value <em>to whom</em>? And, within the broad field of objectivity, the\nmarket value of a product does not reflect its <em>philosophically objective</em>\nvalue, but only its <em>socially objective</em> value.",
