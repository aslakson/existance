(There is also the\nextreme nominalist position, the modern one, which consists of declaring that\nthe problem [of universals] is a meaningless issue, that &#x201C;reality&#x201D; is a\nmeaningless term, that we can never know whether our concepts correspond to\nanything or not, that our knowledge consists of words&#x2014;and that words are an\narbitrary social convention.)",

On this view, the concept (the\nterm) means only those characteristics initially decreed to be &#x201C;essential.&#x201D; The\nother characteristics of the subsumed concretes bear no necessary connection to\nthe &#x201C;essential&#x201D; characteristics, and are excluded from the concept&#x2019;s meaning.",

      "content": "The nominalist view that a concept is merely a shorthand tag for its\ndefinition, represents a profound failure to grasp the function of a definition\nin the process of concept-formation. The penalty for this failure is that the\nprocess of definition, in the hands of the nominalists, achieves the exact\nopposite of its actual purpose. The purpose of a definition is to keep a\nconcept distinct from all others, <em>to keep it connected to a specific group\nof existents</em>. On the nominalist view, it is precisely this connection\nthat is severed: as soon as a concept is defined, it ceases to designate\n<em>existents</em>, and designates instead only the defining characteristic.",
