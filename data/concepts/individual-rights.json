Life is a\nprocess of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the right to life means\nthe right to engage in self-sustaining and self-generated action&#x2014;which means:\nthe freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being\nfor the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own\nlife. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of\nhappiness.)",
