The subject of\npatents and copyrights is <em>intellectual</em> property.",

In the case\nof copyrights, the most rational solution is Great Britain&#x2019;s Copyright Act of\n1911, which established the copyright of books, paintings, movies, etc. for the\nlifetime of the author and fifty years thereafter.",

      "content": "As an objection to the patent laws, some people cite the fact that two\ninventors may work independently for years on the same invention, but one will\nbeat the other to the patent office by an hour or a day and will acquire an\nexclusive monopoly, while the loser&#x2019;s work will then be totally wasted. This\ntype of objection is based on the error of equating the potential with the\nactual. The fact that a man <em>might</em> have been first, does not alter the fact\nthat he <em>wasn&#x2019;t</em>. Since the issue is one of commercial rights, the loser in a\ncase of that kind has to accept the fact that in seeking to trade with others\nhe must face the possibility of a competitor winning the race, which is true of\nall types of competition.",
