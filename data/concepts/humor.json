      "content": "Humor is the denial of metaphysical importance to that which you laugh at. The\nclassic example: you see a very snooty, very well dressed dowager walking down\nthe street, and then she slips on a banana peel .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. What&#x2019;s funny about it?\nIt&#x2019;s the contrast of the woman&#x2019;s pretensions to reality. She acted very grand,\nbut reality undercut it with a plain banana peel. That&#x2019;s the denial of the\nmetaphysical validity or importance of the pretensions of that woman.\nTherefore, humor is a destructive element&#x2014;which is quite all right, but its\nvalue and its morality depend on what it is that you are laughing at. If what\nyou are laughing at is the evil in the world (provided that you take it\nseriously, but occasionally you permit yourself to laugh at it), that&#x2019;s fine.\n[To] laugh at that which is good, at heroes, at values, and above all at\nyourself [is] monstrous .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The worst evil that you can do, psychologically,\nis to laugh at yourself. That means spitting in your own face.",

      "content": "Humor is not an unconditional virtue; its moral character depends on its\nobject. To laugh at the contemptible, is a virtue; to laugh at the good, is a\nhideous vice. Too often, humor is used as the camouflage of moral cowardice.",
