But the communist world has\ngained a moral sanction, a stamp of civilized respectability from the Western\nworld&#x2014;it has gained the West&#x2019;s assistance in deceiving its victims&#x2014;it has\ngained the status and prestige of an equal partner, thus establishing the\nnotion that the difference between human rights and mass slaughter is merely a\ndifference of political opinion.",

There is no\nmargin for error about a monstrosity that was created for the alleged purpose\nof preventing wars by uniting the world against any aggressor, but proceeded to\nunite it against any victim of aggression. The expulsion of a <em>charter member</em>,\nthe Republic of China&#x2014;an action forbidden by the U.N.&#x2019;s own Charter&#x2014;was a\n&#x201C;moment of truth,&#x201D; a naked display of the United Nations&#x2019; soul.",
