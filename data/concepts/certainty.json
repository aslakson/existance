The\npronouncement means that no knowledge of any kind is possible to man, i.e.,\nthat man is not conscious. Furthermore, if one tried to accept that catch\nphrase, one would find that its second part contradicts its first: if nobody\ncan be certain of anything, then everybody can be certain of everything he\npleases&#x2014;since it cannot be refuted, and he can claim he is not certain he is\ncertain (which is the purpose of that notion).",
