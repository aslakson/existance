      "content": "The particular form of economic organization, which is becoming more and more\napparent in this country, as an outgrowth of the power of pressure groups, is\none of the worst variants of statism: <em>guild socialism</em>. Guild socialism robs\nthe talented young of their future&#x2014;by freezing men into professional castes\nunder rigid rules. It represents an open embodiment of the basic motive of most\nstatists, though they usually prefer not to confess it: the entrenchment and\nprotection of mediocrity from abler competitors, the shackling of the men of\nsuperior ability down to the mean average of their professions. That theory is\nnot too popular among socialists (though it has its advocates)&#x2014;but the most\nfamous instance of its large-scale practice was Fascist Italy.",

And of all the various\nstatist-collectivist systems, the one they chose as their goal is,\npolitico-economically, the least practical; intellectually, the least\ndefensible; morally, the most shameful: guild socialism.",

      "content": "What makes guild socialism cruder than (but not different from) most\nstatist-collectivist theories is the fact that it represents the other, the\nusually unmentioned, side of altruism: it is the voice, not of the givers, but\nof the receivers. While most altruistic theorists proclaim &#x201C;the common good&#x201D; as\ntheir justification, advocate self-sacrificial service to the &#x201C;community,&#x201D; and\nkeep silent about the exact nature or identity of the recipients of\nsacrifices&#x2014;guild socialists brazenly declare themselves to be the recipients\nand present their claims to the community, demanding its services. If they want\na monopoly on a given profession, they claim, the rest of the community must\ngive up the right to practice it. If they want a university, they claim, the\ncommunity must provide it.",
