      "content": "The basic political principle of the Objectivist ethics is: no man may\n<em>initiate</em> the use of physical force against others.  No man&#x2014;or group or\nsociety or government&#x2014;has the right to assume the role of a criminal and\ninitiate the use of physical compulsion against any man.  Men have the right to\nuse physical force <em>only</em> in retaliation and <em>only</em> against those who initiate\nits use.  The ethical principle involved is simple and clear-cut: it is the\ndifference between murder and self-defense.  A holdup man seeks to gain a\nvalue, wealth, by killing his victim; the victim does not grow richer by\nkilling a holdup man.  The principle is: no man may obtain any values from\nothers by resorting to physical force.",

Force invalidates and paralyzes a man&#x2019;s\njudgment, demanding that he act against it, thus rendering him morally\nimpotent. A value which one is forced to accept at the price of surrendering\none&#x2019;s mind, is not a value to anyone; the forcibly mindless can neither judge\nnor choose nor value. An attempt to achieve the good by force is like an\nattempt to provide a man with a picture gallery at the price of cutting out his\neyes. Values cannot exist (cannot be valued) outside the full context of a\nman&#x2019;s life, needs, goals, and <em>knowledge</em>.",
