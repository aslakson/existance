More specifically, I\ndisapprove of, disagree with, and have no connection with, the latest\naberration of some conservatives, the so-called &#x201C;hippies of the right,&#x201D; who\nattempt to snare the younger or more careless ones of my readers by claiming\nsimultanteously to be followers of my philosophy and advocates of anarchism.\nAnyone offering such a combination confesses his inability to understand\neither. Anarchism is the most irrational, anti-intellectual notion ever spun by\nthe concrete-bound, context-dropping, whim-worshiping fringe of the\ncollectivist movement, where it properly belongs.",

      "content": "Above all, do not join the wrong <em>ideological</em> groups or movements, in\norder to &#x201C;do something.&#x201D; By &#x201C;ideological&#x201D; (in this context), I mean groups or\nmovements proclaiming some vaguely generalized, undefined (and, usually,\ncontradictory) <em>political</em> goals. (E.g., the Conservative Party, which\nsubordinates reason to faith, and substitutes theocracy for capitalism; or the\n&#x201C;libertarian&#x201D; hippies, who subordinate reason to whims, and substitute\nanarchism for capitalism.) To join such groups means to reverse the\nphilosophical hierarchy and to sell out fundamental principles for the sake of\nsome superficial political action which is bound to fail. It means that you\nhelp the defeat of <em>your</em> ideas and the victory of your enemies. (For a\ndiscussion of the reasons, see &#x201C;The Anatomy of Compromise&#x201D; in my book\n<a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/ayn-rand-works/capitalism-the-unknown-ideal.html\"><cite>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</cite></a>.)",
