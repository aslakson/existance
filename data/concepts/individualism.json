Individualism holds that a civilized society, or any form\nof association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among men, can be achieved\nonly on the basis of the recognition of individual rights&#x2014;and that a group, as\nsuch, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members.",

An agreement\nreached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many\nindividual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. The primary act&#x2014;the\nprocess of reason&#x2014;must be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal\namong many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his\nlungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for\nanother. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be\nshared or transferred.",
