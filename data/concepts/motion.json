For instance, the concept &#x201C;walking&#x201D;\ndenotes a certain kind of motion performed by living entities possessing legs,\nand does not apply to the motion of a snake or of an automobile. The concept\n&#x201C;swimming&#x201D; denotes the motion of any living entity propelling itself through\nwater, and does not apply to the motion of a boat. The concept &#x201C;flying&#x201D; denotes\nthe motion of any entity propelling itself through the air, whether a bird or\nan airplane.",

A thing&#x2019;s location is the place where it is situated.\nBut a moving object is not at any one place&#x2014;it is in motion. One can locate a\nmoving object only in the sense of specifying the location of the larger fixed\nregion through which it is moving during a given period of time. For instance:\n&#x201C;Between 4:00 and 4:05 p.m., the car was moving through New York City.&#x201D; One can\nnarrow down the time period and, correspondingly, the region; but one cannot\nnarrow down the time to nothing in the contradictory attempt to locate the\nmoving car at a single, fixed position. If it is moving, it is not at a fixed\nposition.",
