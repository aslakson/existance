      "content": "The practitioners of the literary school diametrically opposed to mine&#x2014;the\nschool of Naturalism&#x2014;claim that a writer must reproduce what they call &#x201C;real\nlife,&#x201D; allegedly &#x201C;as it is,&#x201D; exercising no selectivity and no value-judgments.\nBy &#x201C;reproduce,&#x201D; they mean &#x201C;photograph&#x201D;; by &#x201C;real life,&#x201D; they mean whatever\ngiven concretes they happen to observe; by &#x201C;as it is,&#x201D; they mean &#x201C;as it is\nlived by the people around them.&#x201D; But observe that these Naturalists&#x2014;or the\ngood writers among them&#x2014;are extremely selective in regard to two attributes of\nliterature: <em>style</em> and <em>characterization</em>. Without selectivity, it would be\nimpossible to achieve any sort of characterization whatever, neither of an\nunusual man nor of an average one who is to be offered as statistically typical\nof a large segment of the population. Therefore, the Naturalists&#x2019; opposition to\nselectivity applies to only one attribute of literature: the content or\n<em>subject</em>. It is in regard to his choice of subject that a novelist must\nexercise no choice, they claim.",

      "content": "The Naturalists object that a plot is an artificial contrivance, because in\n&#x201C;real life&#x201D; events do not fall into a logical pattern. That claim depends on\nthe observer&#x2019;s viewpoint, in the literal sense of the word &#x201C;viewpoint.&#x201D; A\nnearsighted man standing two feet away from the wall of a house and staring at\nit, would declare that the map of the city&#x2019;s streets is an artificial, invented\ncontrivance. That is not what an airplane pilot would say, flying two thousand\nfeet above the city. The events of men&#x2019;s lives follow the logic of men&#x2019;s\npremises and values&#x2014;as one can observe if one looks past the range of the\nimmediate moment, past the trivial irrelevancies, repetitions and routines of\ndaily living, and sees the essentials, the turning points, the direction of a\nman&#x2019;s life.",

This is predominantly true&#x2014;and this is the chief esthetic argument\n<em>against</em> the Naturalist position. Art is a selective recreation of reality,\nits means are evaluative abstractions, its task is the concretization of\nmetaphysical essentials. To isolate and bring into clear focus, into a single\nissue or a single scene, the essence of a conflict which, in &#x201C;real life,&#x201D; might\nbe atomized and scattered over a lifetime in the form of meaningless clashes,\nto condense a long, steady drizzle of buckshot into the explosion of a\nblockbuster&#x2014;<em>that</em> is the highest, hardest and most demanding function of art.\nTo default on that function is to default on the essence of art and to engage\nin child&#x2019;s play along its periphery.",

The premise that man does not\npossess volition, that his destiny is determined by an innate &#x201C;tragic flaw,&#x201D; is\nfundamental in Shakespeare&#x2019;s work. But, granted this false premise, his\napproach is metaphysical, not journalistic. His characters are not drawn from\n&#x201C;real life,&#x201D; they are not copies of observed concretes nor statistical\naverages: they are grand-scale abstractions of the character traits which a\ndeterminist would regard as inherent in human nature: ambition, power-lust,\njealousy, greed, etc.",

      "content": "No matter how concrete-bound their theories forced them to be, the writers of\nthe Naturalist school still had to exercise their power of abstraction to a\nsignificant extent: in order to reproduce &#x201C;real-life&#x201D; characters, they had to\nselect the characteristics they regarded as essential, differentiating them\nfrom the non-essential or accidental. Thus they were led to substitute\nstatistics for values as a criterion of selectivity: that which is\nstatistically prevalent among men, they held, is metaphysically significant and\nrepresentative of man&#x2019;s nature; that which is rare or exceptional, is not.

Why are the problems of a bearded lady of greater\nuniversal significance than the problems of a genius? Why is the soul of a\nmurderer worth studying, but not the soul of a hero?",
