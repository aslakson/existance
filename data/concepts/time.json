Time\napplies only within the universe, when you define a standard&#x2014;such as the\nmotion of the earth around the sun. If you take that as a unit, you can say:\n&#x201C;This person has a certain relationship to that motion; he has existed for\nthree revolutions; he is three years old.&#x201D; But when you get to the universe as\na whole, obviously no standard is applicable. You cannot get outside the\nuniverse. The universe is eternal in the literal sense: non-temporal, out of\ntime.",
