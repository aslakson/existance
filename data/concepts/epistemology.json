Does\nman acquire knowledge by a process of reason&#x2014;or by sudden revelation from a\nsupernatural power?  Is reason a faculty that identifies and integrates the\nmaterial provided by man&#x2019;s senses&#x2014;or is it fed by innate ideas, implanted in\nman&#x2019;s mind before he was born?  Is reason competent to perceive reality&#x2014;or\ndoes man possess some other cognitive faculty which is superior to reason?  Can\nman achieve certainty&#x2014;or is he doomed to perpetual doubt?  The extent of your\nself-confidence&#x2014;and of your success&#x2014;will be different, according to which set\nof answers you accept.",

      "content": "Man is neither infallible nor omniscient; if he were, a discipline such as\nepistemology&#x2014;the theory of knowledge&#x2014;would not be necessary nor possible: his\nknowledge would be automatic, unquestionable and total.  But such is not man&#x2019;s\nnature.  Man is a being of volitional consciousness: beyond the level of\npercepts&#x2014;a level inadequate to the cognitive requirements of his survival&#x2014;man\nhas to acquire knowledge by his own effort, which he may exercise or not, and\nby a process of reason, which he may apply correctly or not.  Nature gives him\nno automatic guarantee of his mental efficacy; he is capable of error, of\nevasion, of psychological distortion.  He needs a <em>method</em> of cognition, which\nhe himself has to discover: he must discover how to use his rational faculty,\nhow to validate his conclusions, how to distinguish truth from falsehood, how\nto set the criteria of <em>what</em> he may accept as knowledge.  Two questions are\ninvolved in his every conclusion, conviction, decision, choice or claim: <em>What</em>\ndo I know?&#x2014;and: <em>How</em> do I know it?",
