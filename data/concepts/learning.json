Men can cooperate in the discovery of new\nknowledge, but such cooperation requires the independent exercise of his\nrational faculty by every individual scientist. Man is the only living species\nthat can transmit and expand his store of knowledge from generation to\ngeneration; but such transmission requires a process of thought on the part of\nthe individual recipients.",
