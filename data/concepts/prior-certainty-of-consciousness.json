      "content": "Descartes began with the basic epistemological premise of every Witch Doctor (a\npremise he shared explicitly with Augustine): &#x201C;the prior certainty of\nconsciousness,&#x201D; the belief that the <em>existence</em> of an external world is not\nself-evident, but must be proved by deduction from the contents of one&#x2019;s\nconsciousness&#x2014;which means: the concept of consciousness as some faculty other\nthan the faculty of perception&#x2014;which means: the indiscriminate contents of\none&#x2019;s consciousness as the irreducible primary and absolute, to which reality\n<em>has</em> to conform. What followed was the grotesquely tragic spectacle of\nphilosophers struggling to <em>prove</em> the existence of an external world by\nstaring, with the Witch Doctor&#x2019;s blind, inward stare, at the random twists of\ntheir conceptions&#x2014;then of perceptions&#x2014;then of sensations.",
