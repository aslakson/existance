When a\ngiven group of existents has more than one characteristic distinguishing it\nfrom other existents, man must observe the relationships among these various\ncharacteristics and discover the one on which all the others (or the greatest\nnumber of others) depend, i.e., the fundamental characteristic without which\nthe others would not be possible. This fundamental characteristic is the\n<em>essential</em> distinguishing characteristic of the existents involved, and the\nproper <em>defining</em> characteristic of the concept.",
