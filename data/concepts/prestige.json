These two\naspects are necessarily interrelated, but a man&#x2019;s desire may be focused\npredominantly on one or the other. The desire for the unearned in spirit is the\nmore destructive of the two and the more corrupt. It is a desire for <em>unearned\ngreatness</em>; it is expressed (but not defined) by the foggy murk of the term\n&#x201C;<em>prestige</em>.&#x201D; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",
