The distinguishing characteristics\nof such writers are grand-scale themes and characters, no plots and an\noverwhelming sense of tragedy, the sense of a &#x201C;malevolent universe.&#x201D; The chief\nexponents of this category were poets.  The leading one is Byron, whose name\nhas been attached to this particular, &#x201C;Byronic,&#x201D; view of existence: its essence\nis the belief that man must lead a heroic life and fight for his values even\nthough he is doomed to defeat by a malevolent fate over which he has no\ncontrol.",
