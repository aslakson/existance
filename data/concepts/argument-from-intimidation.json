It is a method of bypassing logic by means of\npsychological pressure .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. [It] consists of threatening to impeach an\nopponent&#x2019;s character by means of his argument, thus impeaching the argument\nwithout debate.  Example: &#x201C;Only the immoral can fail to see that Candidate X&#x2019;s\nargument is false.&#x201D;  .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.  The falsehood of his argument is asserted\narbitrarily and offered as proof of his immorality.",

      "content": "The Argument from Intimidation dominates today&#x2019;s discussions in two forms.  In\npublic speeches and print, it flourishes in the form of long, involved,\nelaborate structures of unintelligible verbiage, which convey nothing clearly\nexcept a moral threat.  (&#x201C;Only the primitive-minded can fail to realize that\nclarity is oversimplification.&#x201D;) But in private, day-by-day experience, it\ncomes up wordlessly, between the lines, in the form of inarticulate sounds\nconveying unstated implications.  It relies, not on <em>what</em> is said, but on\n<em>how</em> it is said&#x2014;not on content, but on tone of voice.",

      "content": "Let me emphasize that the Argument from Intimidation does <em>not</em> consist of\nintroducing moral judgment into intellectual issues, but of <em>substituting</em>\nmoral judgment for intellectual argument.  Moral evaluations are implicit in\nmost intellectual issues; it is not merely permissible, but <em>mandatory</em> to pass\nmoral judgment when and where appropriate; to suppress such judgment is an act\nof moral cowardice.  But a moral judgment must always <em>follow</em>, not <em>precede</em>\n(or supersede), the reasons on which it is based.",
