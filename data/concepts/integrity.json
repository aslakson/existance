Integrity is loyalty to one&#x2019;s convictions and\nvalues; it is the policy of acting in accordance with one&#x2019;s values, of\nexpressing, upholding and translating them into practical reality. If a man\nprofesses to love a woman, yet his actions are indifferent, inimical or\ndamaging to her, it is his lack of integrity that makes him immoral.",
