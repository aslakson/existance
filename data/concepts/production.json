Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to\nyou by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food\nby means of nothing but physical motions&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ll learn that man&#x2019;s mind is\nthe root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed\non earth.",

The proportion of these two elements varies in different types\nof work. At the lowest end of the scale, the mental effort required to perform\nunskilled manual labor is minimal. At the other end, what the patent and\ncopyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mental effort in the\nproduction of material values.",
