Entities\n(and their actions) are measured by their attributes (length, weight, velocity,\netc.) and the standard of measurement is a concretely specified unit\nrepresenting the appropriate attribute. Thus, one measures length in inches,\nfeet and miles&#x2014;weight in pounds&#x2014;velocity by means of a given distance\ntraversed in a given time, etc.",

      "content": "Observe the multiple role of measurements in the process of concept-formation,\nin both of its two essential parts: differentiation and integration. Concepts\ncannot be formed at random. All concepts are formed by first differentiating\ntwo or more existents from other existents. All conceptual differentiations are\nmade in terms of <em>commensurable characteristics</em> (i.e., characteristics\npossessing a common unit of measurement). No concept could be formed, for\ninstance, by attempting to distinguish long objects from green objects.\nIncommensurable characteristics cannot be integrated into one unit.",

Degrees of intensity can\nbe and are measured approximately, on a comparative scale. For instance, the\nintensity of the emotion of joy in response to certain facts varies according\nto the importance of these facts in one&#x2019;s <em>hierarchy</em> of values; it varies in\nsuch cases as buying a new suit, or getting a raise in pay, or marrying the\nperson one loves. The intensity of a process of thought and of the intellectual\neffort required varies according to the <em>scope</em> of its content; it varies when\none grasps the concept &#x201C;table&#x201D; or the concept &#x201C;justice,&#x201D; when one grasps that 2\n+ 2 = 4 or that e = mc<sup>2</sup>.",

When discussing man&#x2019;s consciousness, particularly his emotions,\nsome persons use the word &#x201C;measurement&#x201D; as a pejorative term&#x2014;as if an attempt\nto apply it to the phenomena of consciousness were a gross, insulting,\n&#x201C;materialistic&#x201D; impropriety. The question &#x201C;Can you measure love?&#x201D; is an example\nand a symptom of that attitude.",
