When he develops his first values and conscious\nconvictions, particularly as he approaches adolescence, he feels an intense\ndesire to share them with a friend who would understand him; if frustrated, he\nfeels an acute sense of loneliness. (Loneliness is specifically the experience\nof this type of child&#x2014;or adult; it is the experience of those who have\nsomething to offer. The emotion that drives conformists to &#x201C;belong,&#x201D; is not\nloneliness, but fear&#x2014;the fear of intellectual independence and responsibility.\nThe thinking child seeks equals; the conformist seeks protectors.)",
