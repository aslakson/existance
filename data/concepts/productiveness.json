      "content": "The virtue of <em>Productiveness</em> is the recognition of the fact that productive\nwork is the process by which man&#x2019;s mind sustains his life, the process that\nsets man free of the necessity to adjust himself to his background, as all\nanimals do, and gives him the power to adjust his background to himself.\nProductive work is the road of man&#x2019;s unlimited achievement and calls upon the\nhighest attributes of his character: his creative ability, his ambitiousness,\nhis self-assertiveness, his refusal to bear uncontested disasters, his\ndedication to the goal of reshaping the earth in the image of his values.\n&#x201C;Productive work&#x201D; does not mean the unfocused performance of the motions of\nsome job. It means the consciously chosen pursuit of a productive career, in\nany line of rational endeavor, great or modest, on any level of ability. It is\nnot the degree of a man&#x2019;s ability nor the scale of his work that is ethically\nrelevant here, but the fullest and most purposeful use of his mind.",

      "content": "Productiveness is your acceptance of morality, your recognition of the fact\nthat you choose to live&#x2014;that productive work is the process by which man&#x2019;s\nconsciousness controls his existence, a constant process of acquiring knowledge\nand shaping matter to fit one&#x2019;s purpose, of translating an idea into physical\nform, of remaking the earth in the image of one&#x2019;s values&#x2014;that <em>all</em> work is\ncreative work if done by a thinking mind, and no work is creative if done by a\nblank who repeats in uncritical stupor a routine he has learned from\nothers&#x2014;that your work is yours to choose, and the choice is as wide as your\nmind, that nothing more is possible to you and nothing less is human&#x2014;that to\ncheat your way into a job bigger than your mind can handle is to become a\nfear-corroded ape on borrowed motions and borrowed time, and to settle down\ninto a job that requires less than your mind&#x2019;s full capacity is to cut your\nmotor and sentence yourself to another kind of motion: decay&#x2014;that your work is\nthe process of achieving your values, and to lose your ambition for values is\nto lose your ambition to live&#x2014;that your body is a machine, but your mind is\nits driver, and you must drive as far as your mind will take you, with\nachievement as the goal of your road&#x2014;that the man who has no purpose is a\nmachine that coasts downhill at the mercy of any boulder to crash in the first\nchance ditch, that the man who stifles his mind is a stalled machine slowly\ngoing to rust, that the man who lets a leader prescribe his course is a wreck\nbeing towed to the scrap heap, and the man who makes another man his goal is a\nhitchhiker no driver should ever pick up&#x2014;that your work is the purpose of your\nlife, and you must speed past any killer who assumes the right to stop you,\nthat any value you might find outside your work, any other loyalty or love, can\nbe only travelers you choose to share your journey and must be travelers going\non their own power in the same direction.",
