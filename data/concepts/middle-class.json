It\nis a broad reservoir of energy, it is a country&#x2019;s motor and lifeblood, which\nfeeds the rest. The common denominator of its members, on their various levels\nof ability, is: independence. The upper classes are merely a nation&#x2019;s past; the\nmiddle class is its future.",

Do not ask, therefore, for whom the bell of inflation is\ntolling; it tolls for you. It is not at the destruction of a handful of the\nrich that inflation is aimed (the rich are mostly in the vanguard of the\ndestroyers), but at the middle class.",
