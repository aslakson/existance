That premise is\nshared by the enemies and the champions of capitalism alike; it provides the\nformer with a certain inner consistency, and disarms the latter by a subtle,\nyet devastating aura of moral hypocrisy&#x2014;as witness, their attempts to justify\ncapitalism on the ground of &#x201C;the common good&#x201D; or &#x201C;service to the consumer&#x201D; or\n&#x201C;the best allocation of resources.&#x201D; (<em>Whose</em> resources?)",

Yet that is the methodology adopted by most political economists.\nTheir attitude, in effect, amounts to the unstated, implicit postulate: &#x201C;Man is\nthat which fits economic equations.&#x201D; Since he obviously does not, this leads to\nthe curious fact that in spite of the practical nature of their science,\npolitical economists are oddly unable to relate their abstractions to the\nconcretes of actual existence.",
