Mill rejected the concept of individual rights and\nreplaced it with the notion that the &#x201C;public good&#x201D; is the sole justification of\nindividual freedom.  (Society, he argued, has the power to enslave or destroy\nits exceptional men, but it should <em>permit</em> them to be free, because it\nbenefits from their efforts.) Among the many defaults of the conservatives in\nthe past hundred years, the most shameful one, perhaps, is the fact that they\naccepted John Stuart Mill as a defender of capitalism.",
