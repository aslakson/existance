But the abstraction being concretized is\nprimarily epistemological, rather than metaphysical; the abstraction is man&#x2019;s\nconsciousness, i.e., his method of cognitive functioning, which he experiences\nin the concrete form of hearing a specific piece of music.  A man&#x2019;s acceptance\nor rejection of that music depends on whether it calls upon or clashes with,\nconfirms or contradicts, his mind&#x2019;s way of working. The metaphysical aspect of\nthe experience is the sense of a world which he is able to grasp, to which his\nmind&#x2019;s working is appropriate.",
