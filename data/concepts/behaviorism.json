[B.F.]\nSkinner is archetypical in this respect: he is passionately intent on being\naccepted as a &#x201C;scientist&#x201D; and complains that only [the concept of] &#x201C;Autonomous\nMan&#x201D; stands in the way of such acceptance (which, I am sure, is true).  Mr.\nSkinner points out scornfully that primitive men, who were unable to see the\ndifference between living beings and inanimate objects, ascribed the objects&#x2019;\nmotions to conscious gods or demons, and that science could not begin until\nthis belief was discarded.  In the name of science, Mr. Skinner switches\ndefiantly to the other side of the same basic coin: accepting the belief that\nconsciousness is supernatural, he refuses to accept the existence of man&#x2019;s\nmind.",

A great deal goes on inside the skin, and physiology\nwill eventually tell us more about it&#x201D; [<cite>Beyond Freedom and Dignity</cite>, p. 195].\nThis means: No, man is not empty, he is a solid piece of meat.",

In <cite>Beyond Freedom and Dignity</cite>, Skinner states that &#x201C;a person\ndoes not act upon the world, the world acts upon him.&#x201D; Thoughts do not cause\nactions, according to Skinner, but are simply another type of behavior: &#x201C;covert\nbehavior.&#x201D; Learning is not defined cognitively (as the acquisition of\nknowledge) but as a change in behavior, caused by the environment.  Behaviorism\ndispenses with such concepts as the self or personality, emotion, and mental\nillness, and replaces them with behaviorally defined notions such as response\nrepertoire, bodily reaction, and abnormal behavior.",
