      "content": "The symbol of all relationships among [rational] men, the moral symbol of\nrespect for human beings, is <em>the trader</em>. We, who live by values, not by loot,\nare traders, both in matter and in spirit. A trader is a man who earns what he\ngets and does not give or take the undeserved. A trader does not ask to be paid\nfor his failures, nor does he ask to be loved for his flaws. A trader does not\nsquander his body as fodder or his soul as alms. Just as he does not give his\nwork except in trade for material values, so he does not give the values of his\nspirit&#x2014;his love, his friendship, his esteem&#x2014;except in payment and in trade\nfor human virtues, in payment for his own selfish pleasure, which he receives\nfrom men he can respect. The mystic parasites who have, throughout the ages,\nreviled the traders and held them in contempt, while honoring the beggars and\nthe looters, have known the secret motive of their sneers: a trader is the\nentity they dread&#x2014;a man of justice.",
