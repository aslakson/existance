      "content": "A vulgar variant of concept stealing, prevalent among avowed mystics and\nirrationalists, is a fallacy I call the <em>Reification of the Zero</em>.  It\nconsists of regarding &#x201C;nothing&#x201D; as a <em>thing</em>, as a special, different\nkind of <em>existent</em>.  (For example, see Existentialism.) This fallacy\nbreeds such symptoms as the notion that presence and absence, or being and\nnon-being, are metaphysical forces of equal power, and that being is the\nabsence of non-being.  E.g., &#x201C;Nothingness is prior to being.&#x201D; (Sartre)&#x2014;&#x201C;Human\nfinitude is the presence of the <em>not</em> in the being of man.&#x201D; (William\nBarrett)&#x2014;&#x201C;Nothing is more real than nothing.&#x201D; (Samuel Beckett)&#x2014;&#x201D;<i lang=\"de\">Das Nichts nichtet</i>&#x201D; or &#x201C;Nothing noughts.&#x201D; (Heidegger).\nConsciousness, then, is not a stuff, but a <em>negation</em>.  The subject is\nnot a thing, but a non-thing.  The subject carves its own world out of Being by\nmeans of negative determinations.  Sartre describes consciousness as a\n&#x2018;noughting nought&#x2019; (<i lang=\"fr\">n&#xE9;ant n&#xE9;antisant</i>).  It is a\nform of being other than its own: a mode &#x2018;which has yet to be what it is, that\nis to say, which is what it is, that is to say, which is what it is not and\nwhich is not what it is.&#x2019;&#x201D; (Hector Hawton, <cite>The Feast of Unreason</cite>,\nLondon: Watts &amp; Co., 1952, p. 162.)",
