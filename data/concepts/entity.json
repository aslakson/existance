Of man&#x2019;s five cognitive senses, only two provide\nhim with a direct awareness of entities: sight and touch.  The other three\nsenses&#x2014;hearing, taste and smell&#x2014;give him an awareness of some of an entity&#x2019;s\nattributes (or of the consequences produced by an entity): they tell him that\nsomething makes sounds, or something tastes sweet, or something smells fresh;\nbut in order to perceive this something, he needs sight and/or touch.",

I\ncan, however, give you three descriptive characteristics essential to the\nprimary, philosophic use of the term, according to Objectivism.  This is not a\ndefinition, because I&#x2019;d have to rely ultimately on pointing to make these\npoints clear, but it will give you certain criteria for the application of the\nterm in the primary sense .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",
