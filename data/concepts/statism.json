The differences among statist systems are only a matter\nof time and degree; the principle is the same.  Under statism, the government\nis not a policeman, but a legalized criminal that holds the power to use\nphysical force in any manner and for any purpose it pleases against legally\ndisarmed, defenseless victims.",

      "content": "A statist is a man who believes that some men have the right to force, coerce,\nenslave, rob, and murder others.  To be put into practice, this belief has to\nbe implemented by the political doctrine that the government&#x2014;the state&#x2014;has\nthe right to <em>initiate</em> the use of physical force against its citizens.  How\noften force is to be used, against whom, to what extent, for what purpose and\nfor whose benefit, are irrelevant questions.  The basic principle and the\nultimate results of all statist doctrines are the same: dictatorship and\ndestruction.  The rest is only a matter of time.",

The history of all primitive peoples is a succession\nof tribal wars and intertribal slaughter.

A\ndictatorship is a gang devoted to looting the effort of the productive citizens\nof its own country.  When a statist ruler exhausts his own country&#x2019;s economy,\nhe attacks his neighbors.  It is his only means of postponing internal collapse\nand prolonging his rule.  A country that violates the rights of its own\ncitizens, will not respect the rights of its neighbors.  Those who do not\nrecognize individual rights, will not recognize the rights of nations: a nation\nis only a number of individuals.",
