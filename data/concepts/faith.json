Live and act within the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to\nthe limit of your life.  Redeem your mind from the hockshops of authority.\nAccept the fact that you are not omniscient, but playing a zombie will not give\nyou omniscience&#x2014;that your mind is fallible, but becoming mindless will not\nmake you infallible&#x2014;that an error made on your own is safer than ten truths\naccepted on faith, because the first leaves you the means to correct it, but\nthe second destroys your capacity to distinguish truth from error.",
