It is\nusually called &#x201C;nature&#x201D; when we think of it as a system of interconnected,\ninteracting entities governed by law. So &#x201C;nature&#x201D; really means the universe of\nentities acting and interacting in accordance with their identities. What,\nthen, is &#x201C;super-nature&#x201D;? Something beyond the universe, beyond entities, beyond\nidentity. It would have to be: a form of existence beyond existence&#x2014;a kind of\nentity beyond anything man knows about entities&#x2014;a something which contradicts\neverything man knows about the identity of that which is. In short, a\ncontradiction of every metaphysical essential.",

      "content": "They claim that they perceive a mode of being superior to your existence on\nthis earth. The mystics of spirit call it &#x201C;another dimension,&#x201D; which consists\nof denying dimensions. The mystics of muscle call it &#x201C;the future,&#x201D; which\nconsists of denying the present. To exist is to possess identity. What identity\nare they able to give to their superior realm? They keep telling you what it is\n<em>not</em>, but never tell you what it <em>is</em>. All their identifications\nconsist of negating: God is that which no human mind can know, they say&#x2014;and\nproceed to demand that you consider it knowledge&#x2014;God is non-man, heaven is\nnon-earth, soul is non-body, virtue is non-profit, A is non-A, perception is\nnon-sensory, knowledge is non-reason. Their definitions are not acts of\ndefining, but of wiping out.",
