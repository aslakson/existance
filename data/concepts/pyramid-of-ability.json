      "content": "In proportion to the mental energy he spent, the man who creates a new\ninvention receives but a small percentage of his value in terms of material\npayment, no matter what fortune he makes, no matter what millions he earns. But\nthe man who works as a janitor in the factory producing that invention,\nreceives an enormous payment in proportion to the mental effort that his job\nrequires of <em>him</em>. And the same is true of all men between, on all levels of\nambition and ability. The man at the top of the intellectual pyramid\ncontributes the most to all those below him, but gets nothing except his\nmaterial payment, receiving no intellectual bonus from others to add to the\nvalue of his time. The man at the bottom who, left to himself, would starve in\nhis hopeless ineptitude, contributes nothing to those above him, but receives\nthe bonus of all of their brains. Such is the nature of the &#x201C;competition&#x201D;\nbetween the strong and the weak of the intellect. Such is the pattern of\n&#x201C;exploitation&#x201D; for which you have damned the strong.",
