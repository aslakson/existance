      "content": "The American system is <em>not</em> a democracy. It is a constitutional\nrepublic. A democracy, if you attach meaning to terms, is a system of unlimited\nmajority rule .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. a form of collectivism, which denies individual rights .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.\nThe American system is a constitutionally limited republic, restricted to the\nprotection of individual rights. In such a system, majority rule is applicable\nonly to lesser details, such as the selection of certain personnel. But the\nmajority has no say over the <em>basic</em> principles governing the\ngovernment. It has no power to ask for or gain the infringement of individual\nrights.",
