Language is a code of\nvisual-auditory symbols that serves the psycho-epistemological function of\nconverting concepts into the mental equivalent of concretes. Language is the\nexclusive domain and tool of concepts. Every word we use (with the exception of\nproper names) is a symbol that denotes a concept, i.e., that stands for an\nunlimited number of concretes of a certain kind.",

This system\nserves as the context, the frame-of-reference, by means of which man grasps and\nclassifies (and studies further) every existent he encounters and every aspect\nof reality. Language is the physical (visual-audible) implementation of this\nsystem.",

To a person who understands the function of language, it makes no\ndifference what sounds are chosen to name things, provided these sounds refer\nto clearly defined aspects of reality. But to a tribalist, language is a mystic\nheritage, a string of sounds handed down from his ancestors and memorized, not\nunderstood. To him, the importance lies in the perceptual concrete, the <em>sound</em>\nof a word, not its meaning.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",
