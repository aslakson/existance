Some\ndream of a universe in which man experiences nothing but happiness&#x2014;no pain, no\nfrustration, no illness&#x2014;and wonder why they lose the desire to improve their\nlife on earth. Some feel that they would be brave, honest, ambitious in a world\nwhere everyone automatically shared these virtues&#x2014;but not in the world as it\nis. Some dread the thought of eventual death&#x2014;and never undertake the task of\nliving.",
