The universe is not\nin space any more than it is in time. To be &#x201C;in a position&#x201D; means to have a\ncertain relationship to the boundary of some container. E.g., you are in New\nYork: there is a point of the earth&#x2019;s surface on which you stand&#x2014;that&#x2019;s your\nspatial position: your relation to this point. All it means to say &#x201C;There is\nspace between two objects&#x201D; is that they occupy different positions. In this\ncase, you are focusing on two relationships&#x2014;the relationship of one entity to\nits container and of another to its container&#x2014;simultaneously.",
