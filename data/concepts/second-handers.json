The man who cheats and lies, but preserves\na respectable front. He knows himself to be dishonest, but others think he&#x2019;s\nhonest and he derives his self-respect from that, second-hand. The man who\ntakes credit for an achievement which is not his own. He knows himself to be\nmediocre, but he&#x2019;s great in the eyes of others. The frustrated wretch who\nprofesses love for the inferior and clings to those less endowed, in order to\nestablish his own superiority by comparison .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. They&#x2019;re second-handers .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",

      "content": "After centuries of being pounded with the doctrine that altruism is the\nultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the only way it could be accepted. By\nseeking self-esteem through others. By living second-hand. And it has opened\nthe way for every kind of horror. It has become the dreadful form of\nselfishness which a truly selfish man couldn&#x2019;t have conceived. And now, to cure\na world perishing from selflessness, we&#x2019;re asked to destroy the self. Listen to\nwhat is being preached today. Look at everyone around us. You&#x2019;ve wondered why\nthey suffer, why they seek happiness and never find it. If any man stopped and\nasked himself whether he&#x2019;s ever held a truly personal desire, he&#x2019;d find the\nanswer. He&#x2019;d see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions\nare motivated by other men. He&#x2019;s not really struggling even for material\nwealth, but for the second-hander&#x2019;s delusion&#x2014;prestige. A stamp of approval,\nnot his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has\nsucceeded. He can&#x2019;t say about a single thing: &#x201C;This is what I wanted because I\nwanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.&#x201D;",

      "content": "A [second-hander] is one who regards the consciousness of other men as superior\nto his own and to the facts of reality. It is to a [second-hander] that the\nmoral appraisal of himself by others is a primary concern which supersedes\ntruth, facts, reason, logic. The disapproval of others is so shatteringly\nterrifying to him that nothing can withstand its impact within his\nconsciousness; thus he would deny the evidence of his own eyes and invalidate\nhis own consciousness for the sake of any stray charlatan&#x2019;s moral sanction. It\nis only a [second-hander] who could conceive of such absurdity as hoping to win\nan intellectual argument by hinting: &#x201C;But people won&#x2019;t <em>like</em> you!&#x201D;",

The\nindependent man kills them&#x2014;because they don&#x2019;t exist within him and that&#x2019;s the\nonly form of existence they know.
