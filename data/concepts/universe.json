      "content": "To grasp the axiom that existence exists, means to grasp the fact that nature,\ni.e., the universe as a whole, cannot be created or annihilated, that it cannot\ncome into or go out of existence. Whether its basic constituent elements are\natoms, or subatomic particles, or some yet undiscovered forms of energy, it is\nnot ruled by a consciousness or by will or by chance, but by the Law of\nIdentity. All the countless forms, motions, combinations and dissolutions of\nelements within the universe&#x2014;from a floating speck of dust to the formation of\na galaxy to the emergence of life&#x2014;are caused and determined by the identities\nof the elements involved. Nature is the <em>metaphysically given</em>&#x2014;i.e., the\nnature of nature is outside the power of any volition.",
