      "content": "Some people ask whether local groups or provinces have the right to secede from\nthe country of which they are a part. The answer is: on ethnic grounds, no.\nEthnicity is not a valid consideration, morally or politically, and does not\nendow anyone with any special rights. As to other than ethnic grounds, remember\nthat rights belong only to individuals and that there is no such thing as\n&#x201C;group rights.&#x201D; If a province wants to secede from a dictatorship, or even from\na mixed economy, in order to establish a free country&#x2014;it has the right to do\nso. But if a local gang, ethnic or otherwise, wants to secede in order to\nestablish its own government controls, it does not have that right. No group\nhas the right to violate the rights of the individuals who happen to live in\nthe same locality. A wish&#x2014;individual or collective&#x2014;is not a right.",
