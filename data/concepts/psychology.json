      "content": "As a science, psychology is barely making its first steps. It is still in the\nanteroom of science, in the stage of observing and gathering material from\nwhich a future science will come. This stage may be compared to the\npre-Socratic period in philosophy; psychology has not yet found a Plato, let\nalone an Aristotle, to organize its material, systematize its problems and\ndefine its fundamental principles.",
