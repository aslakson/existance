The Dark Ages and the Middle Ages are the existential monument\nto <em>this</em> theory of ethics.",

      "content": "A mystic code of morality demanding self-sacrifice cannot be promulgated or\npropagated without a supreme ruler that becomes the collector of the\nsacrificing. Traditionally, there have been two such collectors: either God or\nsociety. The collector had to be inaccessible to mankind at large, and his\nauthority had to be revealed only through an elite of special intermediaries,\nvariously called &#x201C;high priests,&#x201D; &#x201C;commissars,&#x201D; &#x201C;Gauleiters,&#x201D; etc.",
