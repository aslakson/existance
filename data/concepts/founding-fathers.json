      "content": "The Founding Fathers were neither passive, death-worshipping mystics nor\nmindless, power-seeking looters; as a political group, they were a phenomenon\nunprecedented in history: they were <em>thinkers</em> who were also men of action.\nThey had rejected the soul-body dichotomy, with its two corollaries: the\nimpotence of man&#x2019;s mind and the damnation of this earth; they had rejected the\ndoctrine of suffering as man&#x2019;s metaphysical fate, they proclaimed man&#x2019;s right\nto the pursuit of happiness and were determined to establish on earth the\nconditions required for man&#x2019;s proper existence, by the &#x201C;unaided&#x201D; power of their\nintellect.",

      "content": "In the modern world, under the influence of the pervasive new climate, a\nsuccession of thinkers developed a new conception of the nature of government.\nThe most important of these men and the one with the greatest influence on\nAmerica was John Locke.  The political philosophy Locke bequeathed to the\nFounding Fathers is what gave rise to the new nation&#x2019;s distinctive\ninstitutions.  That political philosophy is the social implementation of the\nAristotelian spirit.",

      "content": "The genius of the Founding Fathers was their ability not only to grasp the\nrevolutionary ideas of the period, but to devise a means of implementing those\nideas in practice, a means of translating them from the realm of philosophic\nabstraction into that of sociopolitical reality.  By defining in detail the\ndivision of powers within the government and the ruling procedures, including\nthe brilliant mechanism of checks and balances, they established a system whose\noperation and integrity were independent, so far as possible, of the moral\ncharacter of any of its temporary officials&#x2014;a system impervious, so far as\npossible, to subversion by an aspiring dictator or by the public mood of the\nmoment.",
