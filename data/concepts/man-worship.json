Yet this is the view with which&#x2014;in various degrees of\nlonging, wistfulness, passion and agonized confusion&#x2014;the best of mankind&#x2019;s\nyouth start out in life. It is not even a view, for most of them, but a foggy,\ngroping, undefined sense made of raw pain and incommunicable happiness. It is a\nsense of enormous expectation, the sense that one&#x2019;s life is important, that\ngreat achievements are within one&#x2019;s capacity, and that great things lie ahead.",
