      "content": "The task of the decorative arts is to ornament utilitarian objects, such as\nrugs, textiles, lighting fixtures, etc. This is a valuable task, often\nperformed by talented artists, but it is not an art in the\nesthetic-philosophical meaning of the term. The psycho-epistemological base of\nthe decorative arts is not conceptual, but purely sensory: their standard of\nvalue is appeal to the senses of sight and/or touch. Their material is colors\nand shapes in nonrepresentational combinations conveying no meaning other than\nvisual harmony; the meaning or purpose is concrete and lies in the specific\nobject which they decorate.",
