The mystics of spirit call it &#x201C;another dimension,&#x201D; which consists\nof denying dimensions. The mystics of muscle call it &#x201C;the future,&#x201D; which\nconsists of denying the present. To exist is to possess identity. What identity\nare they able to give to their superior realm? They keep telling you what it is\n<em>not</em>, but never tell you what it <em>is</em>. All their identifications consist of\nnegating: God is that which no human mind can know, they say&#x2014;and proceed to\ndemand that you consider it knowledge&#x2014;God is non-man, heaven is non-earth,\nsoul is non-body, virtue is non-profit, A is non-A, perception is non-sensory,\nknowledge is non-reason. Their definitions are not acts of defining, but of\nwiping out.",
