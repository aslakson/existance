      "content": "Utilitarianism is a union of hedonism and Christianity.  The first teaches man\nto love pleasure; the second, to love his neighbor.  The union consists in\nteaching man to love his neighbor&#x2019;s pleasure.  To be exact, the Utilitarians\nteach that an action is moral if its result is to maximize pleasure among men\nin general.  This theory holds that man&#x2019;s duty is to serve&#x2014;according to a\npurely quantitative standard of value.  He is to serve not the well-being of\nthe nation or of the economic class, but &#x201C;the greatest happiness of the\ngreatest number,&#x201D; regardless of who comprise it in any given issue.  As to\none&#x2019;s <em>own</em> happiness, says [John Stuart] Mill, the individual must be\n&#x201C;disinterested&#x201D; and &#x201C;strictly impartial&#x201D;; he must remember that he is only one\nunit out of the dozens, or millions, of men affected by his actions.  &#x201C;All\nhonor to those who can abnegate for themselves the personal enjoyment of life,&#x201D;\nsays Mill, &#x201C;when by such renunciation they contribute worthily to increase the\namount of happiness in the world.&#x201D;",
