A free nation&#x2014;a\nnation that recognizes, respects and protects the individual rights of its\ncitizens&#x2014;has a right to its territorial integrity, its social system and its\nform of government. The government of such a nation is not the ruler, but the\nservant or <em>agent</em> of its citizens and has no rights other than the rights\n<em>delegated</em> to it by the citizens for a specific, delimited task (the task of\nprotecting them from physical force, derived from their right of self-defense)\n.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.",

Whether a free nation chooses to do so or not is a matter of its own\nself-interest, <em>not</em> of respect for the nonexistent &#x201C;rights&#x201D; of gang rulers. It\nis not a free nation&#x2019;s <em>duty</em> to liberate other nations at the price of\nself-sacrifice, but a free nation has the right to do it, when and if it so\nchooses.",
